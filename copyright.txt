 * The JNOS 2.0 project began in October of 2004, and is an evolution of the
 * original JNOS 1.11f project by James P. Dugal (N5KNX) and contributors. I
 * have taken the original JNOS 1.11f project, and rebranded it as JNOS 2.0,
 * but with significant bug fixes, enhancements, new features, and so on.
