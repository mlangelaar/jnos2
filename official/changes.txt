 I try to update the latest documentation project when time permits :

   https://www.langelaar.net/jnos2/documents/j2addendum.txt

 Latest version of the documentation project is included in the rsync area
  (not updated yet for this latest version 2.0o, thanks for your patience)

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 MARCH 3, 2023 - The latest official release is now JNOS 2.0o

 *** The BIG news is the introduction of IPV6 (native JNOS code) ***

 Big thanks to Bob Tenty, VE3TOK, for pushing me on this, and testing !


 differences between 2.0o.2 and 2.0o - April 5, 2023
 ---------------------------------------------------

  1) Mostly work on IPV6 code, see README.ipv6 for latest details

  2) I have put debugging into nr4subr.c, trying to nail down a really nasty
     situation, bug, not sure what to call it, gcc related ? no idea if that
     is true or not, hopefully JNOS logs will give some detail IF it happens
     on your system. JNOS will crash in the netrom code, and the bizarre thing
     is that the callback pointer is always 0x10000000 when it happens, yup.
      [ REMOVED April 18 - was actually 'killing' use of NETROM ]

  3) From Michael Ford (WZ0C), tested by him and Charles Hargrove (N2NOV)

     Encountering an issue where when receiving a large-ish bulletin over the
     Netrom4 path between two JNOS systems, after every NR4-window-size frames,
     the transfer would hang until the NR4-ack-timer timed out. It appears to
     be because the standard piggyback-ack mechanism does not kick in, in the
     one-way data transfer. Tried reducing the NR4-ack-timer to near zero as
     a workaround, and while it worked, it didn't seem like a permanent fix.

     For something more workable, I implemented a counter of unacked NR4 rx
     frames, and whenever the counter reaches 4, it sends an ack. I have the
     NR4 window set to 10. Acking after every few packets is more efficient
     than after every one, doesn't impact the sender, and prevents timeout.

     I did some short research into more formal ack'ing algorithms but chose to
     go with a quick implementation rather than something more sophisticated.

     It may be worth making the "4" configurable.
      (note to myself, not done yet)

     WARNING - netrom structure changes - mass recompile mandatory !

     files modified by this patch : nr4timer.c nr4subr.c nr4.h nr4.c
      (the original ackissue.diff I got from WZ0C is also in the rsync area)

 END of 'differences between 2.0o.2 and 2.0o - April 5, 2023 ...


 differences between 2.0o and 2.0m.5Gz - March 3, 2023
 -----------------------------------------------------

  1) JNOS 2.0 now handles incoming IPV6 traffic (ping and telnet for now)

   Please refer to the document README.ipv6, included in this rsync,
   for more complete information on what is currently available, and
   how to use it. This is just the start, there's lots left to do.

   One thing to point out ; even if you have NO interest in using IPV6, the
   front end processing for IP traffic is much better in this JNOS version.

   So unless you specifically configure the IPV6 iface, the default action
   is to discard all incoming IPV6 traffic right at the front door. It goes
   no where near the deeper IP code. This version also does basic screening
   for garbage IP traffic, which further minimizes any risk of crap getting
   deep into the IP code - previous versions of JNOS are actually at risk.

  All of the development code has been merged into this latest release,
  so my development rsync area is technically empty for the time being.

  2) How to use the NinoTNC with JNOS (courtesy of Mark Phillips)

       attach asy ttyACM0 - ax25 2M 2048 256 57600 f16

     And another shout out to Teensy RPR 'modem' - just a standard attach asy

  3) An important fix to convers server code, to better handle null link
     pointers and/or bad session names, hoping it solves some crashes.

  4) The JNOS smtp server is now MIME aware when delivering mail to the
     local mail areas, add the following define to your config.h if you
     wish to try it out :

       #define KLM_MAILIT_MIMEAWARE

   IF you choose to enable this feature, any MIME content is now processed,
   attachments are saved to user paths taken from ftpusers file, any base64
   encoded content is decoded, so when a user checks their mail, all they
   should see is text/plain and text/html, the rest will be references to
   any saved attachments. The text/hmtl probably should go elsewhere, but
   for now, this is how it all works. It will evolve as time permits.

   Warning - this alters the BODY (not the headers) of how the incoming mail
   will appear to the user. If you plan on forwarding your local mail areas
   to other systems, any referred attachments will obviously not make it to
   the remote systems you forward with - I hope that makes sense.

   A couple of sysops have already told me they are happy with that :]

   I will add another option for those that do NOT want the mail areas to
   be processed by smtp, and would rather just have a mime decode version
   of the RM (read message) and V (verbose message) commands.

   Having said that, another thing to consider is if you use an email client,
   like thunderbird, then having the SMTP processing MIME will not be great,
   since you will no longer be able to directly access the attachments.

   This is most certainly a work in progress, but it seems to work.

  5) For the BBS user, JNOS can now save sent mail to their own area, just
     add the following define to your config.h if you wish to try it out.

       #define J2_FILESENTMSGS

   PENDING ISSUE : if you list your messages, the TO field is not correct, for
   some reason smtpserv is supposed to reindex when adding the new mail entry,
   but it does not seem to be happening, yet if you manually 'index' your own
   mailbox at the JNOS console, it fixes the listing - I am investigating.

  6) Added a lower case BID kludge for N2NOV (Charles), regarding how SID
     is being handle (case sensitivity) with certain forwarding systems.

   Don't be too eager to put it in, but if you feel you need to ? then
   add the following define into your config.h :

     #define LOWER_CASE_BID_KLUDGE

   This has been an ongoing issue for a long time, where there are cases
   of incoming 'sB' proposals where we need force lower casing of the BID,
   to avoid duplicate messages, so this code 'helps to deal with it' :|

  7) Enhancments to the JNOS snmp server

   Added 2 more MIBS for sysLocation and sysContact.

   JNOS should now send a proper NoSuchName (NoSuchObject) response for any
   queries for MIBS that do not exist in the JNOS implementation, replacing
   the previous behaviour of always responding with sysName.0 (hostname) if
   a requested MIB could not be found or wasn't supported.

   NOTE : snmpwalk only works for ifName and ifDesc (nothing else) ...

   The usage (help) dialogue for the snmp command is now read from file,
   using my recent getusage() functions - /jnos/usage/snmp.txt for most
   configurations, you can find this file under usage subdirectory from
   your rsync session. Here is the new syntax for snmp commands :

     JNOS 2.0 - SNMP Configuration

      snmp ifaces     list all ports in numerical index form

      snmp ro community [ipaddr pattern]*

       NOTE : if you do NOT specify an ipaddr pattern, then ANYONE is allowed

      snmp sysLocation [any text]

      snmp sysContact [any text]

   The new MIBS were originally requested by Mark Phillips :]

  8) Enhancements to the JNOS httpvnc (web based bbs) service

   Reminder : make sure you have /jnos/spool/httpvnc.html in place, since
   recent versions of httpvnc service require this file. IF you don't have
   it, then you can find this file under the spool directory from your rsync
   session. This file is customizable, so now you can give your web access
   some personality, and contact information, and such ...

   The 'httpvnc' service on JNOS has been available already for quite a few
   years, aside from some cosmetics, and reduction of JNOS log entries, and
   a compiler warning, the biggest change is ; I want to move away from the
   standard user password, and instead use a security token, similar to how
   it is done by organizations like github ?

   If I am going to allow BBS access via a web browser and from the internet,
   then the security needs to be higher then it ever has been before. So the
   only thing you will notice with this latest update is the Password field
   has been changed to Token field, and it's longer as well, 16 characters.

   In previous versions, the password is taken from ftpusers, same password as
   for other command line and telnet access, and if one considers how insecure
   most of those are, a machine generated token is a better approach. What this
   means is any of your users (including yourself) wanting web access to your
   JNOS BBS will have to be given a token to use instead of their password.

   Since I have yet to develop the Token code, this latest implementation
   expects the user to input a Token of the following format :

     Jst_XXXXXXXX

   where XXXXXXXX is the password from the /jnos/ftpusers file
   (Jst stands for JNOS security token, the ftpusers hack is temporary)

   The average internet surfer will not know to include 'Jst_' in front of
   the Callsign's regular password. This buys me some time to get it done
   the proper way, and allows me to showcase the new setup.

   In the meantime, I need to figure out how to store and manage tokens
   for each callsign (user), including expiry, revocation, and so on.

   The tfn[20] member of HTTPVNCSESS structure has been changed to a pointer,
   so the code now needs to allocate memory for the session file name. I did
   this initially because the compiler complained, but it should also negate
   the possibility of any buffer overflows. Note, this version of code does
   not free it up when done, not a huge deal at this point, next version.

   The 3 check box options have been replaced with actual buttons, so now
   you just have to click on a button, instead of previously having to check
   box the operation you wanted, followed by the enter key. This of course
   refers to the CTRL-A (abort), CTRL-T (escape), and Clear Session File.

   I encourage you to use Apache with the mod_proxy module to fully secure
   your JNOS httpvnc traffic, you can search for 'apache' further down this
   document for more information on how to do this. It works very well ...

  9) Multiple tun ifaces
   
   Thanks to Mark Herson (N2MH) for asking for this - for his MESH stuff :]

   This is only available with linux kernel 2.4 or higher, with the older
   kernel the tun device name is still hardcoded to tun0. Suppose I could
   fix that as well - but I would think nobody is using older kernels any
   more, so why bother ? Okay, well I might fix that up later, we'll see.

   The only thing you need to pay attention to is the DEVICE index in the
   attach command, it is important to increment for each additional tun
   interface, for instance :

     attach tun tun0 1500 0
     attach tun tun1 1500 1

   or if you have created them at boot time ?

     attach tun tun0 1500 0 tun0
     attach tun tun1 1500 1 tun4

 10) JNOS can now attach multiple agwpe / direwolf modems
      (plus additional kiss ports, if supported by the software)

   Make sure to add the following define to your config.h, if you
   want to use the agwpe driver for agwpe and/or direwolf modems :

     #define AGWPE

   The autoexec.nos entries 'could be' as follows :

    attach agwpe vhf 192.168.1.105 8000
    attach kiss vhf_high 1 vhf

    attach agwpe uhf 10.8.10.101 8000
    attach kiss uhf_low 1 uhf

   10Feb2023 correction - we're not sure now if direwolf or agwpe
   modem softwares actually implement the use of additional kiss
   ports like is done in QtSoundModem, but the JNOS agwpe driver
   will stay as is (just in case), does no harm leaving it in.

 11) QtSoundModem support + multiple additional kiss ports

   The winrpr driver will work with QtSoundModem, so make sure to
   add the following define in your config.h if you want to use :

     #define WINRPR

   The autoexec.nos entries 'could be' as follows :

     attach winrpr QtK 192.168.100.105 8105

     attach kiss QtK 1 QtK2
     attach kiss QtK 2 QtK3
     attach kiss QtK 3 QtK4 

   29Jan2023, I have confirmed on the bench this is working fine, BUT
   please do let me know if you are not seeing packets coming into the
   appropriate interfaces, tested with QtTermTCP and QtSoundModem for
   my remote test box.

 12) The WIDTH of the Message Text column in the APRS Message Center should
     now be 'fixed' - previously it wasn't wide enough, and message content
     would wrap around. Also, confirming length of the text input field for
     the "Send a Message" dialogue is 63 characters. Thanks Jean (VE2PKT)

 July 18, 2022
 -------------

 Changes to RSYNC site - [jnos2] module is deprecated.

 It is replaced with two new modules, [official] and [development]

   a) Official version
      ----------------

   The official version is the last stable release.

     rsync -av www.langelaar.net::official .

   Simply create a new directory, then change into it, then run the above
   rsync command as shown, then compile the source code as follows :

     ./configure
     make

   The idea of the ./configure script is to make sure you have necessary
   operating system libraries for the compile and link to succeed. It is
   not flawless, so if you run into issues, do contact me - thank you.

   b) Development version
      -------------------

   The development version is the latest code I feel comfortable releasing
   for test purposes, so the idea is if you want to try out the development
   version, you rsync the development code on top of your official source.

     rsync -av www.langelaar.net::development .

   Make sure to read the README file. It will contain important information
   on how to compile, and what configuration changes are needed, if any ...

   The README file is also available online at the following URL :

     https://www.langelaar.net/jnos2/documents/development.txt

 The development code used to be mixed in with the official release, usually
 in the form of various subdirectories, which was not a great idea - leaving
 lots of room for mistakes, and it was (perhaps always was) very confusing.

 The bottom line is that the official area needs to stay clean.

 The same goes for the official (changes.txt) release history. This too has
 gotten out of control, and needs to stay clean - so any development notes
 will now go into the README file under the development rsync area.

 The latest official release is still at JNOS 2.0m.5Gz


 important configuration check added - January 3, 2022
 -----------------------------------------------------

 - Modified configure script to not allow the following define in config.h :

     #define SPEED_UP_TICK

   This was a badly thought out idea, and breaks timers and stuff, don't use it.
    (not in present form anyways, was experimental from 2013, might revisit)

   Modified makefile, simply to match the configure script version.


 changes to Web Based User BBS interface - November 25, 2021
 -----------------------------------------------------------

 - This now works with apache (mod_proxy module) to give you full protection
   of https during your web sessions with the JNOS httpvnc server. Download
   the latest 'bbs10000.c' source file from the official rsync site, then :

   Add the following directorive to your config.h :

     #define APACHE_MOD_PROXY_BBS10000

   Then recompile as follows :

     rm bbs10000.o ; make

   For the apache server side, add the following to your httpd.conf :

     ProxyPass "/jnosbbs" "http://192.168.4.201:10000"
     ProxyPassReverse "/jnosbbs" "http://192.168.4.201:10000"

   You would place these inside of your *:443 virtual host definition, then
   restart your apache server - that's what I do on my systems anyways ...

   Then I can securely access my httpvnc sessions as follows :

     https://www.langelaar.net/jnosbbs

 - Comments and Caveats

   Do NOT run multiple web sessions (for different users) to your httpvnc site
   if any of them are on the same IP address as the others (ie, you might have
   a group of users all behind the same firewall router). What happens is that
   after the first user logs in, anyone else who tries to do so will actually
   see (without login) the initial users interactions. That's because JNOS at
   present can only depend on IP address to distinguish sessions. That is not
   a huge problem IMHO - as long as you are aware of it.

   The above applies regardless of whether you use mod_proxy or not !

   For mod_proxy, JNOS uses the HTTP header 'X-Forwarded-For' to track the
   actual IP address of connecting web clients.

   Do NOT use the perl tcp proxy server I mentioned before, since there is
   no way for it to provide a unique IP address, unless you happen to find
   one that inserts the HTTP header I mentioned above.

   IF you compile the mod_proxy feature, then httpvnc will only work through
   apache, you can't have mod_proxy and regular working at the same time, so
   it's either mod_proxy for all access or regular for all access, not both.

   Why ? Because I have not figured out how to Rewrite Headers in httpd.conf
   yet, so the code modification earlier does that for me. Once I figure it
   out, then we can ditch the #define mentioned earlier, and run both modes
   of apache (https) and usual (http) direct to JNOS at the same time :]
 

 differences between 2.0m.5Gz and 2.0m.5Gx - September 12, 2021
 --------------------------------------------------------------

 September 12

 - The VARA code now has an Access Mode, successfully able to B2F forward
   with a Winlink Express client running in VARA HF P2P, and the PPP over
   VARA is working 95% as well, latency is not great, but it does work.

   I've had some discussions with the author of VARA (Jose) and now have a
   much better understanding of why this is. At the end of the day, PPP over
   VARA is not great, and certainly not the most efficient way to use VARA.

   I have put together 3 demos (with video), so you can actually see this stuff
   in action, instead of just hearing me talk about it. The links to the videos
   are on the official JNOS 2.0 page, but here they are too :

    "jnos forwarding with winlink express over vara"
       https://www.langelaar.net/jnos2/vara/demo.html   

    "jnos to jnos IP Bridge using PPP over vara"
       https://www.langelaar.net/jnos2/vara/demoIPbridge.html

    "jnos ftp session over IP Bridge using PPP over vara"
       https://www.langelaar.net/jnos2/vara/demoFTP.html

   The PPP was a good and informative experiment, but I need to rethink it ...

   files updated : forward.c, ppp.c, vara.c, version.c, vara.nos

   Please email if you encounter ANY problems, thank you
    (maiko@pcs.mb.ca)

   For the new access mode (forwarding), please refer to the j2addendum.txt
   documention, for any of the IP Bridge stuff, I have updated the document
   called "VARA Software Modem Support" to reflect changes since January.

   Note : The IP Bridge (PPP) feature now requires this extra command :

     varacmd ipbridge


 final fixes and additions to 2.0m.5Gx as of July 15, 2021
 ---------------------------------------------------------

 July 15

  - by request, the ability to run a script of commands on a remote system,
    and log the results to file. Instead of reinventing the wheel, this new
    feature has been made part of the forward.bbs mechanism - so any 'area'
    defined in 'spool/forward.bbs' which ends with '_script' is treated as
    a remote command and log sequence, with no forwarding actually done.

    For example, I want to collect NETROM routing info from a couple of my
    forwarding partners, N2NOV runs JNOS and K5DAT runs BPQ. In JNOS a bbs
    user uses NR to display netrom routing, in BPQ they would use RO. I've
    got the following 2 script entries defined in my forward.bbs file :

     -------
     n2nov_script
     ax25 newyork n2nov-4
     .nr
     +>
     *5
     -------
     k5dat_script
     net k5dat-7
     .ro
     +>
     *10
     -------

   This is just like any forwarding sequence, where I can just do a :

     mbox ki N2nov_script

   and/or

     mbox ki K5dat_script

   Note the capitalized first letter of 'area', since there will never be
   any mail to deliver with these scripts, or you could always add a poll
   option to the 'area' line and not worry about the capitalization.

   Also note the lack of any message areas in the script definitions, it's
   all pure commands, and waiting for results. Hopefully people find it to
   be somewhat useful, we can certaintly build on it, feedback is welcome.

   The output file generated each time is 'area'.dat, for example :

     n2nov_script.dat, k5data_script.dat

  - the previous newfiltercode subdirectory is gone, it's all part of the
    main rsync now, for any of you wondering what happened to it, thanks.

 July 2

  - Removed a line of code I put in from 2015, where I was trying to support
    the '!' or 'A' FSR character in any FS string sent by a remote BBS during
    a forward session. It was a half hazardly attempt, resulting in possible
    corruption of index files for the areas involved in the 'Restart Data'
    situation. Typically one had to 'index <area>' to get things working
    again. So now, all JNOS does is extract the offset, nothing more.

    I need (want) to get this done and over with, it's been left for way too
    long, in the meantime I strongly encourage everyone to update please.

    NOTE : the update only exists in the rsync newfiltercode subdirectory,
           which will get moved into the main release at a later date.

 June 25

  - Fixed a problem where if a user for example tries to 'sb all@ww' at the
    JNOS bbs prompt, and you have user specific rules defined in the rewrite
    file, the posts will be rewritten to the first user specific rule found.

    This is not good at all, but I've fixed the problem. There is an updated
    mailutil.c source file in the rsync newfiltercode subdirectory.

 June 18

  - By request, NEW capability in the rewrite file. One can now have entries
    targeting (such a bad word) specific users / stations. In other words one
    can now add entries that apply to only a FROM <pattern>, for example :

       *@ww:ve4klm  hold
       *@ww ww

    This allows ALL incoming @ww to the ww area, but any @ww coming from me
    is actually sent to the hold area instead. Or you could just refuse any
    @ww coming from me, for example :

       *@ww:ve4klm  refuse
       *@ww ww

    In the case of refuse, it is rejected right when the proposal appears.

    What is new is the addition of the ':' tag, followed by a PATTERN to
    match in the FROM field of the incoming message (no spaces). Yes, it
    is a pattern, not a direct callsign match, sort of a wildcard ...

  You can get the test code from the rsync area as follows :

     rsync -av www.langelaar.net::jnos2/newfiltercode

 June 16

  - nntpserv.c now contains the latest stability fixes

    AND to appease the NNTP police out there ...

    JNOS is getting LOTS of flack due to a recent NNTP incident where internet
    grade foul language and some very inappropriate content was channeled into
    the packet network, so I have modified the code such that JNOS will only
    allow connections to NNTP servers on the 44 network.

    This is supposedly 'to protect sysops from themselves' - not my words and
    not necessarily my choice, but I am really tired of this crap, maybe more
    so the 'software wars type exchanges' that ensued because of it ...

    At the end of the day - we ALL make mistakes, enough said !

 June 15

  - Yesterday, Bob Bruninga WB4APR was kind enough to add an entry for
    the NOSaprs module of JNOS 2.0 to his 'tocall' list maintained at :

      http://aprs.org/aprs11/tocalls.txt

    NOSaprs is now 'assigned' APN2XX, with APZ200 noted as being used by
    older versions of JNOS. It's been quite some time since NOSaprs was
    introduced, so it's not really experimental anymore.

    Thank you Janusz HF1L (ex.SP1LOP) for suggesting this change.

    The APZ200 in aprs.h is now set to APN20H

    IF you have routing for 'apz200', make sure you change the apz200 to
    the new 'apn20h' AFTER you have the new source in place. YES, if you
    use NOSaprs to TX, use 'ax25 route' to set the APRS path, example :

      # 30Dec2020, So K4KPN-10 will catch it and pass it on further
      ax25 route add apz200 rp0 WIDE1-1

 June 7

  - stability fixes to NNTPSERV, test code -> nntpserv_stability_fix.c
     (copy to nntpserv.c, then 'make', feel free to send me JNOS logs)

    NOTE : only applies if you have #define NNTPS in your config.h

 May 27

  - the ax25 heard save/load functionality now includes the ax25 destinations
    and the ax25 digipeated stations heard lists. The save file from the last
    mod can be safely loaded with this mod - you simply won't see the 2 lists
    mentioned above of course. Files changed are axheard.c and axhsort.c

    You 'could' add these commands to the very end of your autoexec.nos :

       # 21May2021, Load the last saved heard lists
       ax25 heard load /tmp/newsaveit.txt

       # 21May2021, save heard lists every 15 minutes from this moment on
       at now+0015 "ax25 heard save /tmp/newsaveit.txt+"

  - warning, the use of '?' in rewrite will most probably crash JNOS, not sure
    why anyone would use it there. IF you do, please educate me - thank you.

 May 20

  - stability fix to the AT functions in at.c - fixed potential for memory
    corruption in the AT entry list, which can trigger JNOS locking up and
    going into an endless loop, also added loop protection (experimental),
    to prevent JNOS from locking up - it really should not happen now ...

  - some BPQ systems are presenting B2F in the SID, which will cause problems,
    since I only wrote the B2F code for Winlink (mostly CMS) interactions, so
    what I have done is modified mboxmail.c to downgrade these connections to
    use B1F instead, until such time I get it properly working and tested.

  - fixed ax25cmd.c, the compile will fail if '#undef BACKUP_AXHEARD'.

 May 10

  - modified multipsk software modem driver as I did agwpe and winrpr below.

 May 7

  - fixed 'endless sockets' bug in agwpe and winrpr software modem drivers.

    added 'backing off' of logged failed software modem connects for awgpe.

  - brand new 'date' command at JNOS console, updated reportRPR.nos script.
     (previous version of script used 'sh date' which creates zombies)


 differences between 2.0m.5Gx and 2.0m.5G - April 18, 2021
 ---------------------------------------------------------

 1) ax25 heard has been 'revamped', new 'heard via digipeater' feature,
    so that you can actually see stations not directly heard, I created
    this due to my crazy obsession with Robust Packet lately and seeing
    all the APRS frames coming in on 30 meters, many via K4KPN-10, nice
    to know who else you can QSO with (indirectly), really liking this.

    the save/load functionality improved, you can specify save and load
    file now, and times are FINALLY accurate on load, this took a lot of
    effort, but worth it in the end I think. I have NOT included saving
    of the latest digipeater heard list (yet), that will be next time.

   WARNING : the heard file from previous versions of JNOS will NOT work
             with this version, unless you modify the file, add a second
             time stamp to the first line of the file, indicating uptime
             of the previous JNOS at the time you saved the heard file.

    To be honest ? I hated the introduction of the 'show' subcommand, so
    the original 'ax25 h <iface>' is back and will stay that way ...

    command help dialogue now taken from a NEW usage/ax25/heard.txt file
     (create new /jnos/usage/ax25 directory, copy heard.txt over to it)

    there is a sample JNOS script 'reportRPR.nos' if you are interested :]
     (it has a problem though, it creates one defunct processes per run, so
       you might not want to use it a lot - I need to fix JNOS shell command)

    I have NOT updated j2addendum.txt (yet)

 2) The VARA IP Bride code now included, no need to extract the tar file anymore

      #define EA5HVK_VARA
      #define PPP
      #define REMOTE_RTS_PTT    (an option if you have no VOX control)

    Going to try again to write VARA for access mode, because quite honestly
    so far it seems to be the only way it's being used, very integrated into
    the winlink system as well by the looks of it ...


 differences between 2.0m.5G and 2.0m.4 - April 1, 2021
 ------------------------------------------------------

 1) Basic DNS malformed packet protection, better error checks and logging,
    bumped up stack size of DNS procs, this fix alone will add significant
    stability to people reporting JNOS crashing (from DNS attacks).

 2) Got a few reports of longer hex values showing up when running the console
    commands like 'ax25 status', 'tcp status', 'netrom status', however when it
    was required to 'kick' or 'reset' by hex value, JNOS would report the call
    back as not valid, preventing people from being able to do such things.

    The fix was fairly easy, replacing htoi() calls with htol() instead.

 3) Robust Packet Interface (KISS over TCP/IP) to WinRPR Software Modem

 4) VARA IP Bridge Interface (TCP/IP) to EA5HVK VARA Software Modem

   As documented, you need to extract the source from varadev.tar. This
   is because the current vara code hardcodes some things in PPP source
   which I have not finalized at release time. Applying the VARA source
   will break any serial PPP configurations you may have running.

   Chances are nobody is using PPP with JNOS anymore, but I need to be sure :]

 5) This update sees the addition of DUPE protection for concurrent forwarding
    sessions from multiple remote hosts, where messages having the same BID are
    coming in from multiple sources, seconds of each other, even within minutes
    of each other in some cases. It should be noted that up till now, JNOS has
    always been vunerable to this, resulting in posting of duplicate messages,
    which in turn get forwarded to other systems, which is just not good.

    The solution up till now has been to stagger forwards with remote partners,
    such that only one partner is forwarding at any particular time. With this
    new feature, we can loosen things up a bit more, and not worry about it.

    Excess messages get deferred (not refused), since we might need them later.

 6) The BID for messages from 'our host' is now in BASE36 format, giving us
    a much bigger range of several million numbers, instead of the original
    range of 99999 and then start over again.

    If you use an email client (like thunderbird) to send messages to your
    JNOS system, you'll notice this version no longer uses a portion of the
    long message-id present in the email header to generate the BID, rather
    it will just create another BASE36 BID from JNOS sequence number pool.

    I figure it is perfectly fine to do this now, since BASE36 extends the
    range of the BID to several million. The original message-id is still
    preserved in the message header anyways, so nothing is lost here.

 7) Protection from getting 2 UA frames after we send a SABM frame, resulting
    in a terribly vicious loop, like a DOS attack, rare scenario encountered,
    some time ago, where the remote software (based on linux ax25 stack) went
    nuts on some of us. Possible ax25 libs were updated, but the software on
    the other end not compiled in a long time and running old libs ? We will
    never know to be honest, but the situation was very real, yup.

 8) Very basic implementation of Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) - why not ?
     (note this is very much a prototype, and needs to evolve over time)

 9) Important changes to the JNOS httpvnc (web based user BBS) service

    Now using POST instead of GET in the form submission, so you won't be
    seeing any user credentials and commands in the URL anywmore, it's all
    hidden in the message body now. The original version had user callsign
    and password exposed in the URL which was just bad, but my knowledge of
    HTTP programming was quite limited at the time I wrote the original
    prototype, so really it is a huge security improvment.

    NOTE : Data is still cleartext over your network since this is HTTP ...

    This version also quickly shuts down those annoying and bandwidth consuming
    favicon http requests that firefox likes to send out in huge volumes, yeah.

    Added a CTRL-A checkbox so a user can abort any SEND (SP, SR, SB) commands.

    Made adjustments to timeout values in the code, removed some pwait() calls
    which didn't seem necessary anymore, and now setting the 'Server:' field in
    the HTTP response header to reflect the more recent JNOS version 2.0m ...

    Cleaned up debugging and general logging to the JNOS logfile.

 10) Important changes to the SID Capture feature.

    The original prototype was written more to help me debug stuff at the time,
    but I figured it might come in handy for others, but the last enhancements
    actually were not really great. In the interest of getting more information
    about the hosts connecting to us, the focus on the connecting callsign was
    lost, the information displayed was confusing, you had no idea who the call
    was in many cases, and it turns out in the end that I introduced bugs into
    the code, so the information at times was even wrong here and there.

    This new version has a much better user friendly layout, being more in line
    with what I originally wanted to do way back then. Now you get the callsign,
    the time of connect, the full SID sent to us, and connection details, as in
    was this a netrom connect, a radio port, a wormhole, telnet connect, etc ?

    For example, on the JNOS console of my development system :

      jnos> mbox sid > /tmp/sid8.txt

    Then from the linux prompt, I can retrieve the content as follows :

      root@slackware:/jnos/src/dev_2.0m.4# more /tmp/sid8.txt

 11) Security - make sure you configure users in ftpusers with BBS permissions
     only for stations you have authorized incoming forwarding with. This will
     protect against rogue or ignorant incoming connects from any stations who
     could then proceed to send a SID, possibly followed by illegal 3rd party
     forwarding or forwarding of malicious messages.

     for BBS permissions OR 0x02000 - so 0x0407f in ftpusers becomes 0x0607f

     Up till now, JNOS has always allowed this, but now JNOS will send a terse
     message to the 'offending' station first, instead of the SID, disrupting
     the message flow - it might require some refinement, let me know please.

     These events are also logged to the JNOS logfile.

     IF this feature causes you grief, then disable it in config.h with :

        #define J2_DONT_ENFORCE_BBS_USER

 12) Added EHLO support to SMTP server. I discovered this by accident when my
     android email app refused to talk to my JNOS, so tcpdump showed me exactly
     the problem, easy enough to add the command. Quite honestly, I thought it
     was there already, oops :|

 13) Instead of hardcoding NETROM parameters, I know several folks have had it
     done, please consider using the following NEW commands in autoexec.nos :

       netrom obsoinit <value>     default is 6, for NEDA use 5
       netrom obsominbc <value>    default is 5, for NEDA use 3

     Same with acktime, use the EXISTING command instead of hardcoding it :

       netrom acktime <value>      default is 3000, for NEDA (?)

 14) Couple of 'stability' mods to netrom code.

 15) Better error logging during saving of the BID to the history file.

 16) Removed first column (gateway ip address) from the 'genencaptxt' file.
      (now it matches the exact same format as a real encap.txt)

 17) If you are running two systems with the same Call Sign

    Please consider staggering your sequence numbers, since the sequence number
    pool is now into the several million range, not constrained to the old 1 to
    99999 and back. For example, in my /jnos/spool/mqueue/sequence.seq, I reset
    the value to 16801420, which starts my base36 bid at ANNNN, way ahead.

    If anyone sees a flaw in this, please talk to me :]

    Not so sure one should be running multi BBS with same callsigns, but ...

 18) Some tweaks to APRS code, for instance making sure to remove trailing 0xc0
     characters from the end of APRS data coming in via a WinRPR interface, and
     also breaking out callsign list management routines - which are no longer
     specific to the APRS aspect of JNOS, also used for IP access and Winlink
     call lists, so they got moved to the new j2KLMlists.[ch] source files.

 19) Fixed some more compiler and linker warnings, some dependant on how one
     modified their config.h file - originally these never would have showed
     for the more standard configurations (if there is such a thing). I also
     added some TNODE 'mods' from Brian (N1URO).

 20) Important for ARM processors, the makefile now FORCES signed char, the
     reason being the linux version of JNOS always assumed signed char, but
     this is a big problem for ARM and Raspberry PI based hardware, which
     actually assumes unsigned char intead - more efficient apparently.

     So BEFORE this got enforced, PI users were complaining about all sorts
     of strange behavior with JNOS and/or outright continuous crashing ...

 21) How to update your JNOS 2.0m.4 system (or just compile fresh)

    WARNING : only apply this update on 2.0m.4 systems, nothing earlier !

    Run rsync on your source tree like you usually would, for example :

      cd <your JNOS source>

      rsync -av www.langelaar.net::jnos2 .

    Note the following new possibilities for your config.h file :

      #define WINRPR    /* kiss over tcp/ip interface to WinRPR */

      #define J2MFA   /* prototoype multi factor authentication */ 

      #define TNODE   /* Brian's TNODE mods */

      #define J2_DONT_ENFORCE_BBS_USER   /* use only if it gives you grief */

      #define EA5HVK_VARA  /* ip bridge tcp/ip interface for VARA */

    Hopefully I have not missed anything (sorry), then compile as usual :

      make clean
      ./configure
      make

 22) No more patch files, all moved into a patches subdirectory again ...
     (the README files in some of them might come in handy, who knows)


 no more patching required AND check for RDATECLI in config.h - August 21, 2020
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 1) The rsync area is now @ version 2.0m.4 - no more patching required !

    All 4 patch files since 2.0m have been moved to a new patches subdirectory,
    and simply there for historic reasons now, NO need to extract them anymore.

    Keep this in mind when you go over the 'differences' further below.

    One important item that I forgot to add to the configure script, was to
    check if the existing config.h has #define RDATECLI and if so, warn the
    user they need to #undef RDATECLI instead - the reason for this is that
    the stime() function no longer exists in the more recent gcc versions.

    As a result, you may get an unresolved reference to stime() during the
    linkage portion of the compile. It isn't a simple change, and since we
    already have 'ntpd' on the linux side, there is no point in supporting
    the JNOS 'rdate' command anymore. So please check your config.h file.


 differences between 2.0m.4 and 2.0m.3 - August 3, 2020
 ------------------------------------------------------

 1) This is a patch to put on top of JNOS 2.0m.3 and strictly deals with
    a couple of compiler and linker problems when using gcc version 10.

    Thanks to Kayne (N9SEO) for reporting this on Manjaro linux.

 2) How to update your existing version 2.0m.3 installation :

     #
     # you don't have to patch anymore as of August 20, 2020
     # WARNING : your existing source MUST be at version 2.0m.3 !
     #

     cd < your jnos source directory >

     rsync -av www.langelaar.net::jnos2 .

     #
     # you don't have to patch anymore as of August 20, 2020
     # tar xvzf jnos_2.0m.4_patch.tar.gz
     #

     # BUT check your config.h - make sure you have #undef RDATECLI

     make clean
     ./configure
     make


 cleaning up the JNOS 2.0 installer and documentation for it, July 8, 2020
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------

 1) removed 'jnosinstaller.c' and the 'installerv2.1' subdirectory from the
    rsync area, replacing them with a new installerv2.2.tar.gz package.

    The documentation and links have been redone for the updated JNOS installer
    on the official JNOS 2.0 website, it should be much less hassle to use, and
    you can once again download it from the installer page as well.

    The installer no longer ships with a generic JNOS binary, it now comes
    with a dummy JNOS (script) basically telling you to compile your own.

    NOTE : the makefile will still try to compile the jnosinstaller, just
           ignore that for now, I will remove it on the next JNOS update.

    The installer is very simplistic, perhaps primitive. The whole idea behind
    it was just to give new JNOS people something to start with, letting them
    build on the autoexec.nos and such - I hope it is of use to some of you.


 differences between 2.0m.3 and 2.0m - July 5, 2020
 --------------------------------------------------

 1) JNOS can now download messages for multiple Winlink User Accounts

    All winlink calls are now configured in one command, for example :

      mbox winlinkcalls VE4KLM VE4PKT VE4NOD

    Here, VE4KLM is my JNOS winlink account, and VE4PKT and VE4NOD are
    the other user accounts for which I want to download messages for.

    Of course the other user accounts are optional and not required.

    You must create a JNOS winlink user account for each user you wish
    to download messages for - example in my case I would do this :

      ./jnospwmgr -a ve4klm -w
      ./jnospwmgr -a ve4pkt -w
      ./jnospwmgr -a ve4nod -w

    Note, I have pluralized the original 'mbox winlinkcall call' command.

 2) JNOS 2.0 Log Triggers - this is new code which gives JNOS the ability to
    run commands based on what it sees in the main log file - in real time.

     a) notify me 'instantly' if Ron's system times out during a session

          log trigger add "VE3CGR&timed out&" "mailmsg ve4klm \"ve3cgr timeout\""

        this looks for 2 phrases "VE3CGR" AND "timed out" and invokes the
        JNOS mailmsg console command to email me saying we've timed out.

        note the use of & for BOTH phrase, it's case sensitive (currently), and
        also note you can include spaces in a phrase. The command only happens
        if BOTH phrases match !

     b) run a shell script if any particular words show up in the log

          log trigger add "error|warning|WARNING|" "sh ./notifyme.sh"

       this looks for 3 phrases "error" OR "warning" OR "WARNING" and runs
       the shell script 'notifyme.sh'. The script will run if ANY single
       phrases is matched.

    At present you can NOT mix use of the '&' and '|' operators.

    If you have only one phrase, you still need to terminate with an operator,
    either one will do. The whole matching algorithm needs work, stay tuned. 

    Documentation could be better, but the examples should help for now.
     (just enter 'log' at JNOS console for usage information)

 3) Moving away from hard coded usage() functions for JNOS console commands.

    This opens up the door for users to customize the usage dialogue to their
    own needs, including writing them in different languages. The plan is to
    also add control codes for paging, color, and so on down the road.

    Note there is a new 'usage' subdirectory in the rsync area, and I will be
    adding files to it as each release comes up. Just 'cp -r usage /jnos/usage'
    or copy them to whatever your JNOS root directory happens to be.

 4) You can now Save and Load the axheard list, to and from file. I felt it was
    important to keep the new commands within the 'ax25 heard' context, so I've
    changed the syntax over previous versions of JNOS and it's now this :

     jnos> ax25 heard
     Usage : ax heard < show | dest > [<iface>]
             ax heard < save | load >

    The filename is 'AxHeardFile' right now, will make it more flexible later.

    This is very experimental. The time stamp on the load might be off in
    certain cases. Would it be useful to have a Save and Load per iface ?

 5) I have enhanced the information available in the SID capture feature.

 6) The makefile now enforces the compiler option '-fsigned-char' so if
    you're running a PI or any ARM based system, it should be okay now.

 7) How to update your existing version 2.0m or later installation :

     #
     # you don't have to patch anymore as of August 20, 2020
     # WARNING : your existing source MUST be at version 2.0m or later !
     #

     cd < your jnos source directory >

     rsync -av www.langelaar.net::jnos2 .

     #
     # you don't have to patch anymore as of August 20, 2020
     # tar xvzf jnos_2.0m.3_patch.tar.gz
     #

     do you have an existing config.h ? maybe compare it to config.h.default ?
      (perhaps you are missing out on a feature, or not, maybe try these below)

       #define BACKUP_AXHEARD   /* save and load axheard list feature */
       #define JNOS_LOG_INCOMING_LOCAL_PORTS   /* experimental port logging */
       #define J2_SID_CAPTURE   /* capturing and logging of SID information */

     time skew warnings are normal, probably means you downloaded something I may
     have just updated within the last several hours, and depending on time zone.

     make clean
     ./configure
     make

     cp -rp jnos jnospwmgr jnosinstaller usage < your jnos runtime directory >

   To back out of this, just repeat above procedure BUT without the 'tar'.

 << end of differences between 2.0m.3 and 2.0m >>


 Announcment regarding 2.0n development - May 27, 2020
 -----------------------------------------------------

 This whole 2.0n and new password management is a bit too much perhaps for the
 majority of JNOS users out there, and I simply got carried away with the work
 done on it. There is an actual concern this will scare people off, so time to
 rethink all of this and stick with the 'traditional approach', starting again
 with version 2.0m, and leaving the ftpusers and popusers approach 'as is'.

 The idea is to repackage the work done for version 2.0n, making it available
 as a 'JNOS 2.0 Security Kit' for people to put on top of 2.0m and subsequent
 versions IF they want more security. I like this idea, so that's the plan.

 The Security Kit will definitely remain in use on any of my JNOS systems.

 I just need some time to re-package the code, so 2.0n.beta is 'no more'.

 Any features and fixes not related to the new password management will
 be kept of course, and be released sometime soon as version 2.0m.1 ... 
  (for example, the JNOS log triggers code)

 Thanks to everyone for your support :]


 a few changes to 2.0n.beta - May 09, 2020
 -----------------------------------------

 No more popusers file, added a new option '-m' to jnospwmgr utility.
  (encrypted, but not hashed as I would like to do, but not today)

 Removed '-#' option for permissions, and '-r' syntax has changed for jnospwmgr utility.

 The '-r' no longer specifies a solitary path, rather, it's what you would have put into your
 fptusers file originally - in other words the primary 'path permission' or multiple sets of,
 as briefly indicated in the JNOS user manual. I can't think of any other way to do this at
 this time, so for example :

  ./jnospwmgr -a ve4klm -r "/jnos/public/ve4klm 0x040ff" -g "ban this guy"

 Also removed any kludge code I put in to deal with FTP issues, that code is no longer needed
 now that the path permission issues are properly resolved (I hope so), please report issues.

 You should not have to change any user password files, UNLESS, you want to specify multiple
 path / permissions for any of them, either use the updated jnospwmgr binary or hand edit.

 Lastly, this release contains the JNOS 2.0 Log Triggers code, more documentation is coming
 on this later, in the meantime, you can refer to this NOS-BBS posting on how to use it :

  http://lists.tapr.org/pipermail/nos-bbs_lists.tapr.org/2020-April/005534.html

 I have updated the gzip tar file '2.0n.beta.update.tar.gz', and the github repository.
  (8 files in main jnos source directory, 2 files in j2pwmgrV2 directory)


 significant change to 2.0n.beta - March 22, 2020
 ------------------------------------------------

 Replaced the use of MD5() with SHA512() in the main portion of the JNOS Password Management
 routines. It's literally a drop in replacement. This does not affect MD5AUTHENTICATE and/or
 WINLINK_SECURE_LOGIN functionality, BUT you will have to import your original ftpusers file
 again, and recreate any additional users (including winlink) if you had any setup before.

 Yeah sorry, it's been a few 'iterations' I guess :]

 I have updated the gzip tar file '2.0n.beta.update.tar.gz', and the github repository.
  (4 files in j2pwmgrV2 directory - j2adduser.c, j2chkuser.c, j2md5bh.c, j2pwmgr.c)

 Maximum password length is 60, that's way overkill, but this was a necessary change.


 differences between 2.0n.beta and 2.0m - February 28, 2020
 ----------------------------------------------------------

 What started off as 2.0m.1 is now 2.0n.beta

 This is a radical change to the JNOS user password authentication, which instantly
 warrants a change to the version MAJOR - it most certainly is not a MINOR change.

 This is something I have been wanting to do for a long time. It is a bit technical
 and might be a handful for some. For that I apologize. Please contact me if you have
 any concerns or are struggling with it - BUT (respectfully asking) not before you've
 given it your all - I just don't have the time anymore, too many things going on.

 Highlights of this update are :

    No more ftpusers file, it's gone

    The BBS user passwords are now hashed (not encrypted), no more cleartext
     (however if MD5AUTHENTICATE is defined, we have no choice but to include
       the encrypted passwords as 'extra information' to the new system)
 
    The Winlink CMS password is properly encrypted again

    The AXHEARD list can now be saved to file or loaded from file, there are
    some notes on this towards the end of this section. Note, this required
    some restructuring of the console 'ax heard' commands, it made sense.

    I have enhanced the information shown by the 'mbox sid' console command

 Documentation -> "https://www.langelaar.net/jnos2/documents/jnos.2.0n.password.management.txt"
 
 This update is only available as a patch, and must only be applied to the official 2.0m version.

 WARNING : do NOT use this on any earlier versions !!!

 Just change directory to your JNOS source and do something like this :

   wget "https://www.langelaar.net/jnos2/downloads/linux/2.0n.beta.update.tar.gz" --no-check-certificate

 Now run these commands below :

   tar xvzf 2.0n.beta.update.tar.gz

   edit your config.h (or config.h.default if you don't have one yet), and make sure this entry exists :

     #define GET_PASSWORD_FROM_J2PWMGR

   make clean
   ./configure
   make

   NOTE : please MAKE SURE you create a new 'users' subdirectory in your JNOS root directory
           (a small oversite on my part, I will correct it later)

 The configure script now warns you if you have INP2011 defined - recommend you #undef INP2011
  (old code, my attempt @ supporting INP3 protocol long ago, some people are reporting JNOS crashing)

 The makefile now enforces the compiler option '-fsigned-char' so if you are running a PI or
 any ARM based system, you should be fine as far as that issue is concerned.

 I have tested this with gcc 6.3.1 (devtoolset-6), it compiles, the link will fail, BUT
 the solution is simple, edit your makefile to make sure 'LCURSES = -lncurses -ltinfo'

 I have not tested convers, and done limited testing on ftp user logins.

 DO NOT use this update IF any of the following apply to your setup :

  1) This update breaks SMTP_VALIDATE_LOCAL_USERS - new function needs to be written

  2) This update breaks PPP - userlookup needs to be rewritten

 Save and Load ax25 Heard List

 The ax25 heard list can now be saved to a file or loaded (restored) from a file.

 Add '#define BACKUP_AXHEARD' to your config.h for this feature.

 Decided to also revamp the 'ax heard' command at the JNOS console, since there are
 now several commands available, all of which really should be categorized as being
 subcommands of 'ax heard' - so with this update, the new syntax is as follows :

     Usage : ax heard < show | dest > [<iface>]
             ax heard < save | load >

 The 'dest' and 'hearddest' commands are gone, absorbed by the above syntax.

 The heard data is kept in a new 'AxHeardFile' in the JNOS root directory.

 There might still be some issues with improper time stamps, please let me know.


 differences between 2.0m and 2.0k.3B - November 27, 2019
 --------------------------------------------------------

 NOTE : version bumped up to 2.0m (skipped the L since in lowercase it looks too
        much like the number one or the letter 'i'), call me mercurial (?)

 IMPORTANT : this started off as Beta release end of September, with additional mods
             added towards the end of October, and was made available through a new
             rsync module, 'jnos2NR' during that time. As of November 27, this code
             is now an official release, the Beta designation has been dropped, so
             please revert back to the standard rsync module 'jnos2' for download.

     cd <empty directory> ; rsync -av www.langelaar.net::jnos2 .

 WARNING : do NOT patch this version with ANY previous release updates !
            (in other words do not use tun.c fix, tnlink patch, whatever)


1) Some changes to the way JNOS is compiled - a new './configure' script

  After you download the release, if you try to run make, it will tell you to
  run './configure' first - this is new to version 2.0m and onwards. The script
  checks to see if the necessary linux development packages are installed - if
  they are missing, it will tell you that, and you won't be able to continue.

  The 'make' will only work if './configure' successfully makes it to the end.

  At present, the script only checks for ncurses, and open-ssl (only if the
  winlink secure login is defined in config.h) -  yes, it scans your config.h
  file. Also, if config.h does not exist, the script now puts in the default,
  not the makefile anymore as in past versions.

  You can run './configure' as many times as you want, but I suggest if you
  make changes to your existing config.h or whatever, then do a 'make clean'
  first, then run the './configure' script. You will have to anyways, since
  the 'make clean' forces you to run the script again.

  NOTE : the configure script is matched to the makefile, you must update
         both files or else './configure' will complain about it and stop.


2) The 'tun.c' compile issues are resolved, no more patching needed.

   Moved a couple of structure definitions out of the ax25.h and tcp.h
   header files, creating two new header files - ifax25.h and iftcp.h

   There is no longer any need for the tun_sp2l.c patch which I first put
   out back in June of 2017, for those trying to compile JNOS 2.0k.1 on a
   debian-stretch-DI-rc4-i386 distro at the time, the idea was to replace
   the existing tun.c with my patch version - was a kludge fix at best.


3) JNOS should (probably) be run as a non-root user, here is how to do it :

  This change was actually provided to me by KB8OJH (Ethan Blanton) back in
  January of 2018, and I have been running it on my development system, it's
  just that I completely forgot to put it into my rsync areas, till now. My
  profuse apologies for this 'terrible' oversight. Please visit his website
  at https://kb8ojh.net, there is some cool information on there.

  Very simple to implement, the procedure is as follows :

  NOTE : these are examples based on my system, most likely you will need
         to change these, or probably you just should change them to suite
         your JNOS runtime environment. Again - these are just examples.

  a) create a new JNOS user and group

       jnos:x:1001:1001::/home/jnos:/bin/bash
       jnos:x:1001:

  b) change ownership of the entire JNOS runtime area

       chown -R jnos:jnos /jnos/rte

  c) as root user, configure a tunN interface, and just leave it there forever.

       ip tuntap add mode tun dev tun4

       ifconfig tun4 192.168.200.200 pointopoint 192.168.200.201 mtu 1500 up

     WARNING : make sure you pick a number N that does not conflict with any
               other tun interfaces that might be running - OpenVPN comes to
               mind for example, some VM subsystems might use tun as well ?

   d) modify autoexec.nos, add an extra parameter to the 'attach tun' entry,
      and make sure to comment out the point to point ifconfig.

      So what was previously run as root, for example, below :

       attach tun tun0 1500 0

       shell ifconfig tun0 192.168.200.200 pointopoint 192.168.200.201 mtu 1500 up

      will now just become a one line entry, below :

       attach tun tun0 1500 0 tun4


4) The '#define B2F' is now permanent in config.h - do NOT #undef it

   For now I have decided to make #define B2F a permanent define, which basically
   relegates the '#ifdef B2F' found all over the code to identifying the areas of
   code specific to B2F operation. If you #undef B2F, you will actually break the
   checksum processing in the B1F protocol, so it is best to leave it in place.

   Thanks to N6MEF (Michael Fox) for accidently discovering the B1F issue :)

   I might even remove the B2F definition in a future release, it does not hurt to
   leave this code in place, it's pretty well established by now, so this minimizes
   the risk of messing up any of the existing forwarding code.

   Which brings us to the next point below ...


5) Introducing the new '#define WINLINK_SECURE_LOGIN' in config.h

   The only reason the openssl developmenet package is required when compiling JNOS
   is because we need the md5 hash routines to support the 'Winlink Secure Login'.

   For those who want to pull mail off the CMS servers, you need to have this
   defined, or else the CMS servers will refuse to let you go any further. Yes,
   you can actually still 'kick wl2k' - search for December 15, 2017 further
   down in this file on how to setup for CMS forwarding - but it will fail.

   Previously '#define B2F' was used to encase the Winlink Secure Login code.
    (but now that it's permanent, we have this new define in place)


6) Bit of a surprise, recent versions of linux are no longer supporting the old
   setkey () and encryp () functions, which has presented me with the problem of
   not being able to encrypt my JNOS 2.0 password management database. Passwords
   are still mangled, that's not the issue, but for now I've had to comment out
   the part which encrypts the mangled values - don't want a 'rushed solution'.

   Looking for a replacement - basically libcrypt (-lcrypt) is no more ...

   IMPORTANT (if you forward with a Winlink CMS) :

    It just means you will have to wipe the /jnos/users directory and run
    the j2pwmgr utility again to recreate the Winlink Secure Login passwd
    information. Unfortunately the files in the directory from before are
    not going to be compatible with this newest version, sorry for that.


7) Support for RMS call (already available in previous release), BUT ...

   The only thing to note is that there is no more 'tnlink' subdirectory,
   the source is now part of the main release. Do NOT use the patch from
   previous version 2.0k.3B - do not use any patch on the new 2.0m !

   If you wish to support Packet Winlink users on your own JNOS, now you can :)

   Originally the define was going to be '#define RMSCALL', but I have decided
   to instead use '#define TNCALL' since the feature can be used with ANY telnet
   service for that matter, even another BBS (how I tested original prototype).

   Please check the release notes for 2.0k.3B (further down) on how to use this.


 8) New way to configure White Page (WP) processing, read carefully please

   The rewrite file is very important and gives the ultimate flexibility in defining
   what your specific JNOS system should process as far as White Page (WP) updates.

   Here is the portion of my rewrite file that I am currently testing with :

     #
     wp@ww                           whitepages
     wp@eu                           whitepages
     wp@ve4klm                       whitepages
     wp@ve4klm.#wpg.mb.can.noam      whitepages
     #
     *@ve4klm.#wpg.mb.can.noam ve4klm
     #

     Files : smtpserv.c, smtpcli.c, wpages.c

   Detailed Documentation for JNOS 2.0 white pages can be found here :

     https://www.langelaar.net/jnos2/archive/documents/practical/wpages


 9) A fix to wildmat.c, added on October 22, thanks to VE3CGR (Ron), who reported
    this long ago, any time he ran the expire command, JNOS would crash. Regarding
    his configuration, he uses NNTP services and his expire.dat is loaded with tons
    of NNTP group names, some with a '?' character as part of the name, triggering
    the crash.

    It's a simple fix, but quite honestly, any of the wildcard stuff turns my brain
    to jello. I still don't understand the changes made in 2014 for N6MEF (Michael),
    but I have been told it's still in use, and working for them - so that's good.


 10) Now checking for missing BID on ALL incoming S proposals - not just SB, but
     also SP, which folks mistakenly use sometimes when sending bulletins. A fix
     to mboxmail.c was provided by N1URO (Brian Rogers), added on October 16.


 11) Fixed several potential string buffer overflows as reported by the compiler.


 12) Investigating removal of passwords from ftpusers and incorporating them into
     the same JNOS 2.0 Password Management Database as currently used for saving
     the Winlink password. At the same time, I am removing the encryption of any
     passwords and replacing them with hash:salt information instead, as per the
     recommendations of several high profile security institutions, meeting the
     need that nobody, not even the administrator, will be able to determine a
     users password (because HASH values only go in one direction).

     One could even consider multiple iterations, one could include the CPU id
     of the physical computer or some other identifier unique to the JNOS host
     setup, locking the password hashes to the specific server JNOS runs on.

     As much as I want to entertain the idea of using HMAC-SHA-256, PBKDF2, or
     whatever the flavour of the year, the code can get complex, so for a first
     time prototype, MD5 is fine - it's JNOS, not a financial institution :|


 13) Investigating the use of multiple REWRITE_TO (in rewrite file) for redundant
     message passing, in case a recipient handling host is down and we simply must
     get it passed some other way ? For example, my rewrite could be :

      *.usa.noam aa6hf#RDN#n1uro

     and have #RDN# processed by the smtp client and server within JNOS ?
      (nothing concrete, just a very intriguing idea at this time)


 addition to 2.0k.3B (version left as is) - August 10, 2019
 ----------------------------------------------------------

1) Here is the Beta version of JNOS RMS support, the only thing that leaves to
   be done is when the Winlink (RMS) Express client has finished a Packet Winlink
   session, the packet side does not disconnect immediately, and depends on the
   client to timeout, or the sysop on the client end needs to STOP the session
   manually - this after the forwarding has finished.

   I want to release this now, since some people are asking about it, and I will
   not be able to work on it for the next few weeks, so now is the time I guess.

   Again, this feature is released as a subdirectory, so when you rsync the
   official release, you will see a new tnlink subdirectory with 10 files.

   IF you are interesting in using your JNOS as an RMS node, copy the 10 files
   to your main source area, add the following define to your config.h file :

	#define TNCALL

   Edit the makefile and add the tnlink.o object to the end of the SERVERS
   section, so that 'wpages.o merge.o sort.o ufgets.o' will now look like
   'wpages.o merge.o sort.o ufgets.o tnlink.o' instead.

   Then do 'make' to compile a new JNOS binary.

 WARNING : you must have the latest official source from rsync if you are
           to copy these files, if you have an older version, you're playing
           with fire, things might compile (or not), but you may wind up with
           an unstable JNOS binary or one that crashes left right and center.

   Choose a callsign you want Winlink (RMS) Express clients to connect to,
   then add an entry similar to the following to your autoexec.nos file :

     ax25 tncall ve4klm-11 cms.winlink.org 8772 cronly

   Obviously I'm using VE4KLM-11 for mine - make sure you change to your own call.

 NOTE : I am assuming you have the 'ax25 mycall' parameter configured in
        your autoexec.nos file. It's used for the CMS application login.

 I have it working with the latest Winlink Express 1.5.22.0 client.

 PLEASE : send me reports and feedback, thank you.

 addition to 2.0k.3B (version left as is) - August 7, 2018
 ---------------------------------------------------------

1) This is something I've been wanting to do for a very long time ...

   I finally got tired of entering the NODES command at the BBS prompt, only
   to watch several hundred entries stream by and miss the one I want, so now
   you can pass a substring to look for (not the same as a pattern), ie :

     Area: ve4klm (#1) >
     nodes uro
     NJDURO:MB7NJD-5   QSOCCT:N1URO-11   SQLURO:N1URO-13    MFNOS:N1URO-14
     RSBYPI:N1URO-2     X-URO:N1URO-3    BBSURO:N1URO-4    UNIVLE:N1URO-5
      DXURO:N1URO-6
     *** 9 nodes displayed

   The 'nodes *' remains the same, the substring filter is case insensitive.

   For the JNOS console, it's a bit more complicated. To accomodate the feature
   into the 'netrom route' console command, the command syntax required fixing.

   Up till now, most people are probably used to entering just 'netrom route'
   to get a node dump, just like if you typed in 'nodes' at the BBS prompt. I
   know it might be convenient, but it breaks syntax convention and makes it
   difficult to add new features, so sorry - you can't do that anymore :)

   Now you have to enter 'netrom route nodes', and if you want to pass the
   substring (like you would at the BBS prompt), then it would look like :

     jnos> netrom route nodes VK 
     DOTXRP:VK2DOT-1   DOTFBB:VK2DOT-6     DOTN:VK2DOT-7    DOTCH:VK2DOT-8
     HGRBBS:VK6HGR-14  HGRNOD:VK6HGR-15  NODHDM:VK7HDM-4
     *** 7 nodes displayed

   This is because 'netrom route' actually has 4 other subcommands, so putting
   in the 'nodes' subcommand brings it all to a nice consistent interface such
   that if you enter just 'netrom route' you see ALL available subcommands.

  NOTE : 3 new files (mboxgate.c, netrom.h, nrcmd.c) in 2.0k.3 subdirectory


 differences between 2.0k.3B and 2.0k.2 - July 24, 2018
 ------------------------------------------------------

1) This is beta code to preserve the CASE of the message id (BID) for any
   messages originating from outside. Don't touch the case of the BID when
   it comes in, and don't touch it on the way out.

   I have been running this for a whole week with a few forwarding partners,
   and so far it seems to be doing the job.

   This patch is strictly about uppercase/lowercase BID - nothing else.

   The format of the BID and/or R: line content is another can of worms :)

  Use following command to retrieve files :

     rsync -av www.langelaar.net::jnos2/2.0k.3 .

  NOTE : it will create a subdirectory called 2.0k.3 (4 files)

 correction to 2.0k.2 (version left as is) - March 25, 2018
 ----------------------------------------------------------

1) I forgot to include 'null terminate fix' in one file, an important one
   at that (aprs.c), and the NOSaprs version will also stay as is @ 2.0h

 correction to 2.0k.2 (version left as is) - December 21, 2017
 -------------------------------------------------------------

1) Completely forgot to look for the 'smtp:' prefix that some people
   use to have winlink deliver third party mail over B2F forwarding,
   so please note an updated fbbfwd.c source file.


 differences between 2.0k.2 and 2.0k.1 - December 15, 2017
 ---------------------------------------------------------

 NOTE : This update is simply a quick fix for some immediate issues ...
         (if you're not doing winlink, not doing APRS, then don't bother)

1) Important updates regarding Winlink and their recent CMS switch over.

 a) My existing forward.bbs configuration stopped working on me, so looking at
    the raw data, seems the new CMS setup is sending me a leading CR character
    before the Callsign prompt (in my JNOS setup anyways). I have corrected my
    entry in forward.bbs to accomodate this. The following is now what I use :

      -------
      wl2k
      telnet cms.winlink.org 8772 cronly
      +Callsign :
      *10
      ..YOURCALLSIGN
      +Password :
      @10
      .CMSTelnet
      wl2k
      -------

    NOTES : '*' takes care of the leading CR character mentioned above
            '.' before the callsign is used to setup the EOL sequence

    I'm embarrassed to admit, my forward.bbs before this point was garbage. I
    should be surprised it even worked. The '+' entry simply sets up a search
    string. You still have to (MUST) use the '@' or '*' entry to actually wait
    for the string to appear before the script continues on - something I had
    failed to do, so basically the script would connect, force feed callsign
    and password to the CMS system without waiting for it's prompts :]

    To initiate forwards with winlink, simply use 'mbox ki Wl2k | wl2k'.

 b) The bigger problem is the appearance of a ';PM' directive in the forward
    session, which breaks the forwarding between JNOS and the winlink CMS :

      MBOX (wl2k) FBB error, last read : ;PM: VE4KLM S2X704ESAGW6 202
       maiko@xxxxxx.xxxx.ca //WL2K testing email pickup via nos system

    The reference page 'https://www.winlink.org/B2F' says the directive gives
    a basic list of mail pending for any users tied to that winlink account.

    JNOS now properly handles the ;PM directive and logs the content.

    * File affected : fbbfwd.c

 c) An update on how to send (SP) messages to any callsign at Winlink :

    NOTES : no entries required in your rewrite file
            define a [wl2k] area in your forward.bbs file

    ANY user at the BBS prompt simply has to do the following :

      sp ve4klm@wl2k

    The next time JNOS does a 'mbox ki wl2k' the message will go out.

    NOTE : start the Subject: line with '//WL2K' or else the CMS system won't
           deliver your message, even if the forward reports a successful b2f
           session as being completed.

    I have code to automatically prefix the '//WL2K' on the users behalf, but
    not adding it right now, since I've got too many other mods in the way.

    * File affected : fbbfwd.c

 d) An update on how to reply (SR) to any message that came in from Winlink :

     same NOTES as section c) above.

    After reading the message with 'r' command, you simply enter 'sr'.

    I have added code to force the reply to the [wl2k] area, so the next time
    you 'mbox ki wl2k', the response will go out. It seems you do not need to
    prefix the reply with '//WL2K', which is already in the subject from the
    original message, so existing code works fine (ie, no subject prompt).

    * File affected : bmutil.c

2) Extended Mail Header features for Outpost clients

   Code is present to allow for displaying of extra mail headers to help
   mail clients like Outpost to better deal with MIME types. The code is
   currently defined out, and requires two other source files which have
   not been included in this release, waiting for people to finalize ...

    * File affected : bmutil.c

3) Trying to fix some issues with APRS internet system

   Fixed a bunch of code where I was sending the null terminator after eol,
   which I'm not sure why I ever did it, but JavaAPRS was not liking it one
   bit, so it seems to be much better now. Typical symptoms were 'erroneus
   packets dropped', 'Invalid source callsign', and data not making it to
   the APRS internet system.

   Looks like I also forgot to move the change of 'IGATE,I' to 'qAR,IGATE'
   into the latest rsync area, not sure how I missed that, I apologize :]

    * Files affected : aprssrv.c, aprs.c, aprsbc.c, aprswx.c, aprs.h

   Should probably bump up the NOSaprs version (I did) - now @ 2.0h


 differences between 2.0k.1 and 2.0k - February 10, 2017
 -------------------------------------------------------

1) One of the bigger JNOS user groups was encountering random hangs of SMTP
   sessions between their systems. Perhaps unique in todays day and age, all
   of their systems are interconnected using TCP/IP over 1200 baud AX25, not
   something many people do much anymore, so that's pretty cool in itself.

  1200 baud TCP/IP probably gets nicely congested, should hangs be a surprise ?

   The raw interface logs clearly show several cases of JNOS sending out a XLZW
   request without getting the expected response from the remote host. It turns
   out the recvline() call waiting for the response simply never had an alarm()
   timeout call set on it, so it would wait forever, stalling the SMTP session,
   until the sysop terminated (reset) the TCB for that SMTP session.

   Thanks to Michael (N6MEF) for his data collection savviness.

   Files : smtpcli.c

2) Added CAPA and UIDL features to the POP3 service. So you can now enable the
   following server settings in your thunderbird (or whatever else) client :

     "Leave messages on server" and (optional) "Until I delete them"

   NOTE : I would restart thunderbird after changing it's server settings :)

   Thanks to Charles (N2NOV) for pushing me to implement this.

   You must add the following line to your config.h file before you compile :

     #define J2_CAPA_UIDL

   Files : pop3serv.c config.h.default

3) The JNOS smtp client is limiting in that if one sends an email to a main
   recipient and multiple carbon copy recipients (all on the same destination
   host), then delivery of carbon copy recipients is delayed till the next SMTP
   tick, and so on. This scenario was observed by N6MEF, so I made a few small
   changes allowing multiple SMTP sessions to exist to the same destination
   host, which should 'solve' the problem, but I feel the need to point out
   something here.

   Is this really a good idea for systems interconnected using TCP/IP over 1200
   baud AX25 ? Enabling multiple SMTP connections to the same host at the same
   time makes me wonder if network congestion is going to become an issue ...

   You must add the following line to your config.h file before you compile :

     #define J2_MULTI_SMTP_SESSION

   This addes a new 'prefix' variable to the 'smtpcli struct'.

   Files : smtp.h smtpcli.c config.h.default

4) Fixed a bug in the convers code where if a link is lost it never reconnects
   again, and more bizarre - link status shows an IP address not even close to
   what it should be for the remote host. Thanks to Ron (VE3CGR) for bugging me
   about this. It turns out the software version information returned from the
   remote host was being allowed to overwrite the socket structure for the link,
   corrupting it's IP address. See my comments (dated 31Aug2016) in the file.

   Also added some code to log sessions to the main JNOS log file.

   Files : convers.c

5) Commented out CC_LIST entries from main JNOS log file, they are of no use in
   a production environment, added 'days since' info to J2_SID_CAPTURE feature,
   which previously displayed only time, so you had no idea if it was today, or
   several days ago.

   Files : mboxmail.c

6) The temporary filename prefix for JNOS is now 'jnos', used to be 'file'.

   Files : j2tmpnam.c

7) JNOS was crashing within the MAIL_LOG_EXTRAS feature because of a couple of
   free() calls which should not have been put in there, this is now fixed.

   Files : smtpserv.c

8) JNOS was crashing within the JNOS_LOG_INCOMING_LOCAL_PORTS feature because
   it was not checking for NULL 'up->name', found while debugging 'smtp kick'.

   Files : main.c

9) Fixed a variety of compiler warnings (depending on config.h settings).

   Files : pop3cli.c, nntpserv.c, expire.c, timed.c, http.c, wpages.c,
            at.c, sessmgr.c, pppcmd.c, ppplcp.c, ppppap.c, pppipcp.c,
             slhc.c, mailbox.c, iproute.c. smtpserv.c

A) Some variable names have changed over the years, reworded a warning entry in
   the main JNOS log, added new features to the default configuration file, and
   of course bumped up the JNOS version number.

   Files : tcpgate.c, ppplcp.c, sockuser.c, config.h.default, version.c


 version change only - 2.0k.rc changed to 2.0k - July 26, 2016
 -------------------------------------------------------------

1) After several weeks of testing by various people, and nothing but good
   reports coming in, it's time to make 2.0k.rc the latest official version,
   but rebrand it as just plain old 2.0k - only one file change (version.c).


 modifications to 2.0k.rc - July 3, 2016
 ---------------------------------------

1) Now presenting B1F instead of BF for incoming connects. It's time to move
   up in the world. We can already handle connecting to a B1F capable system,
   so this technically makes us fully B1F capable now. The 'resume' feature
   however is not 100% and still breaks - trying to fix, testing difficult.

2) Regarding forward.bbs file, JNOS expects a valid connect command immediately
   after the 'area' identifier for a particular BBS entry. If you put a comment
   entry ('#') between the identifier and connect command, then nothing happens
   even though JNOS says it is connected, no socket is assigned. This is fixed,
   so you can now put comments anywhere in the file. Bob (VE3TOK) found this.
 
3) You can now suppress the EOL warnings (put in for linfbb), command is :

     mbox eolwarnings off

   By default, they are enabled - at some point they'll annoy you (maybe).

4) Instructions (to generate a new JNOS binary) :

   IF you already have the original 2.0k.rc, then you simply have to do this :

     rm forward.o mailbox.o mboxcmd.o sockuser.o ; make

   Otherwise follow the instructions for 2.0k.rc below.


 differences between 2.0k.rc and 2.0j.7v - June 26, 2016
 -------------------------------------------------------

 This release sees some significant changes to the source, and quite honestly
 has been a difficult process, not so much the coding and testing, but figuring
 out how to do it all, while keeping everyone relatively happy in the process.

1) Telnet compressed forwarding issues over the last decade or more ...

 In simple terms, for any telnet session, there is one particular character
 value you have to watch out for. The value 255 (0xff) is also known as the
 IAC (interpret as command) byte. It's an escape character which allows for
 the embedding of telnet commands into the session itself. This is detailed
 in RFC 854 (telnet protocol specification), see the webpage link below :

    https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc854

 JNOS has 'support' for IAC in parts of the code, but not in the code that
 does the actual FBB compression (the yapp functions). So what happens is
 that if you have a telnet session with a system that is using IAC as per
 the RFC in the compression routines, JNOS does not care. It does not see
 the IAC as an escape character, it just sees it (and command bytes that
 follow) as just plain old data. The end result is that things 'break'.

 For years, I thought trying to intrepret IAC in these functions would most
 certainly corrupt any compressed data, honestly thinking it was transparent,
 with no imbedded byte sequences and such - well, live and learn eh ?

 I've determined that LINFBB and OBCM both interpret the IAC byte as per the
 RFC for the compressed part, where as JNOS, BPQ, and Winlink (CMS) do not !

 Sooo ... in this version (2.0k) and higher, I have added a flag deep inside
 the socket layer code to flag whether JNOS should process the IAC byte or
 just treat it as data. The default behavior has always been to treat it as
 plain old data. I want to preserve this to ensure backwards compabitity with
 all older versions of JNOS. This is a final decision, there is no going back
 on it, however the sysop actually has a choice (so everyone wins I hope).

 If you have an existing source tree, you MUST add the following directive to
 your 'config.h'. This is to preserve the original JNOS behavior with regard to
 the IAC byte. It's a new compiler directive - it's very important to add it :

    #define JNOS_DEFAULT_NOIAC

 IF you do NOT want to preserve the original behavior (Gus), then remove it.

 Syntax changes
 --------------

    autoexec.nos or JNOS console :

       start telnet [port] [options]

    forward.bbs file :

       telnet host [port] [options]

    In both of the above case, possible options are (single or combined) :

       cronly        telnet listener expects just 0x0d for EOL
       iac           enforce IAC during FBB compression
       noiac         treat IAC as regular data during FBB compression
  
    the 'noiac' option is there for those who choose NOT to preserve the
    original behavior of JNOS regarding IAC when they compile their code.

    IF you are passing options, then you MUST specify a port, so even
    for the default telnet port 23, you will have to specify the 23.

 You can run multiple 'start telnet' commands, different ports and options

 I have put together the following file with forwarding config examples :

   http://www.langelaar.net/jnos2/documents/examples_2.0k.txt

 Thanks to Bob (VE3TOK) and Gus (I0OJJ) for providing much of this !
 
2) Removal of 'mbox fbb 3' and 'mbox noB2F' commands

 I have decided to remove 'mbox fbb 3'. It was a bad mistake from day one, so
 we're back to 'mbox fbb 2' as the default like the original JNOS. Your winlink
 outgoing forwards will not be affected, B2F and FC proposals will still work
 properly, but let's face it, there is no reason to use FC proposals between a
 JNOS system and other JNOS or other BBS software for that matter (yet). There
 is no benefit, and in case anyone hasn't noticed, the RLINE and From headers
 are not properly supported in my FC proposal code (since Winlink didn't need
 any of that). This means we are going back to original functionality, but we
 can still talk to Winlink CMS servers. Since B2F will only be available for
 talking to Winlink, we won't be needing the 'mbox noB2F' command either.

 This too is a final decision, there is no looking back. Apparently Bernard
 polled his community and I have heard through a grape vine that B2F will not
 be incorporated into FBB right now. That does not mean I am removing B2F from
 JNOS, it's just that most other BBS software should not be burdened by it.

3) Forwarded messages (with GMT timestamps) are now indexed to local time when
   they come in, not to GMT time. This should solve several issues for people,
   including those that are using the 'expire future' option.

4) More enhancements to logging of forwarding sessions, including non-FBB ones.

5) SNMP server now has security - you can set community / ip address patterns.

   New command syntax for 'snmp' console command is :

     snmp ifaces		display list of interface index and names

     snmp ro			display the ACL

     snmp ro blahblah		set community name (any ip)

     snmp ro 3R~qWc 192.168.1	set community AND ip
     snmp ro jnos 44
     snmp ro jibberish 1.2.3.4

   This is a prototype, you can only add, not remove to the ACL ...

6) Finally got rid of ALL compiler warnings - my development compiler is :

     gcc version 4.8.3 20140911 (Red Hat 4.8.3-9) (GCC)

   It 'should' compile clean now - please let me know if you find anything.

7) Reinstated validation of the 'F> NN' line for incoming proposals, believe
   it or not it has been commented out for almost 10 years, it really should
   have been left in place.

   The obsolete 'telpac' option has been deleted from 'forward.bbs' file.

   A small change which ensures FQ is only sent when it should be. So far it's
   not created any issues that I can see of with any of my forwarding partners.

   The old MB_XFBB_KLUDGE code has been 'stripped' out, not required any more,
   since telnet service code has been restructured, still same functionality.

8) APRS Message Center crashes possibly (not 100 percent sure) fixed. This was
   reported by Gus (I0OJJ) quite some time ago. A compiler warning made me take
   a look at this more closely, and it's possible it is fixed - needs testing,
   since I've never been able to reproduce the crash.

9) Added new code to deal with inconsistent end of line (EOL) sequences being
   encountered while forwarding with linfbb. JNOS would expect 0x0d 0x0a, but
   at some point linfbb would start sending just 0x0d (no 0x0a at all). If one
   had 'mbox tdisc' configured, JNOS would hang for that time, waiting for the
   0x0a it would never receive, but instead get a first byte of data from the
   next proposal or FBB command, which effective broke the forward session. If
   you did not configure 'mbox tdisc' at all, JNOS would likely hang 'forever'
   depending where it was in the forward session. I have talked with Bernard
   about it, and he is aware of the issue. In the meantime it can be dealt
   with on the JNOS side. 

   Note the newly created EOL gobble structures and code, including a new
   recvchar_witheol () function, which allows us to save any data mistakenly
   interpreted as a EOL byte, and reintroduce it into the data stream a bit
   later on (inside of recvline). The gobble stuff is in sockuser.c file.

A) A few experimental development tools / code you might find handy (or not) :

   I have added a new SID capture capability that will track all SIDS for any
   incoming sessions, and give you the callsigns heard using those SIDS, along
   with the last time that call was heard using that SID. Again, this was more
   a tool I created to help me with development, you might find it useful. To
   try it out, you have to '#define J2_SID_CAPTURE', followed by :

      rm mboxcmd.o mboxmail.o ; make

   If you are running running multiple TCP (telnet) listeners with port values
   higher than 1000 and you want the JNOS log to include the local port for a
   particular incoming telnet session (so you can clearly identifiy which port
   a session is coming in on), you can have JNOS log that information. To try
   it out, you have to '#define JNOS_LOG_INCOMING_LOCAL_PORTS', followed by :

      rm main.o ; make.

B) OpenSSL routines and a DISCLAIMER - goes hand and hand with instructions

     YOU MUST READ : https://www.openssl.org/source

   in particular, the section entitled Legalities - you have been warned !

   This version requires crypto and crypt libraries for the B2F component of
   the software. I am working on a better way to configure this, but for now
   you'll have to install these libs on your linux distribution (examples) :

       RHEL based : yum install 'openssl-devel'

       UBUNTU based : apt-get install libssl-dev

   IF you do not want B2F (Winlink) support, you don't have to install the
   libs, however you will then have to edit the 'makefile' and remove :

     -lcrypto -lcrypt           (and #undef B2F in your config.h of course)

   I have tried to create a Makefile that automatically deals with this, but
   after several hours of tearing hair out of my head, I gave up (for now). I
   will eventually figure it out, but now I just want to get this released.

C) Instructions (to generate a new JNOS binary and password utilities) :

  for default (original) JNOS behaviour with regard to the IAC byte and telnet
  forwarding, MAKE SURE you add the following define to your 'config.h' file if
  you already have an existing source tree :

     #define JNOS_DEFAULT_NOIAC

  after this, just run the usual 'make clean ; make' to generate binaries.


 differences between 2.0j.7v and 2.0j.7u - March 10, 2016
 --------------------------------------------------------

1) I am trying to improve the quality and usefulness of what is logged in the
   main JNOS log file during forwarding sessions, a work in progress, but I'd
   like to get an update out that might be of help to some folks.

   Files : fbbfwd.c, lzhuf.[ch], mailbox.c

2) You can add msgid and subject to log entries made to 'spool/mail.log' by
   adding the following compiler directive to 'config.h' before compiling :

     #define MAIL_LOG_EXTRAS

   Files : smtpserv.c

3) Instructions (to generate a new JNOS binary) :

   rm fbbfwd.o, lzhuf.o mailbox.o, smtpserv.o ; make


 corrections to 2.0j.7u (version left as is, only 1 or 2 people had downloaded)
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * December 9 - Needed a new command to set the winlink callsign. Using the
    value set by the 'ax25 bbscall' command was too restrictive (thanks Gus).

  * December 10 - Fixed an incorrect extern declaration in forward.c, my JNOS
    development system would crash whenever I kicked 'wl2k' area. Surprising,
    the 2 other systems using the latest update were supposedly running fine.


 differences between 2.0j.7u and 2.0j.7t - December 8, 2015
 ----------------------------------------------------------

1) I have not been able to get anything done during most of November and the
   first week of December, due to me being on the road to support my youngest
   in his quest to be the best in long track speedskating, and now that I am
   back home for a while, I still have too much stuff on my plate, oh well.

2) JNOS now supports the Winlink Secure Login requirement for a single user.

   You should give the following URL a very good read, and if you are a winlink
   user, you will have received several notices over the past few months as to
   how the Winlink Secure Login works and why they are doing it :

     http://www.winlink.org/content/cms_login_changes_due_soon

   Files : makefile, forward.c, mboxcmd.c, wlauth.c (new)

   Directory : j2pwmgr (source code for new JNOS password manager prototype)

   I originally used the 'ax25 bbscall' parameter to set the winlink callsign
   used in the challenge response, but Gus (I0OJJ) immediately discovered a big
   problem with that. To begin with, winlink forwarding in JNOS is usually done
   through telnet sessions, where the login call is configured in forward.bbs.
   
   The login call does not necessarily have to be the same as 'ax25 bbscall',
   and in many cases it is not the same, so we need a new JNOS command to get
   around this. You must set your winlink callsign if you are going to forward
   with a winlink server. Use the following new command to do this :

     mbox winlinkcall <callsign>

   The <callsign> should match what you have for 'wl2k' in forward.bbs file.
   
   WARNING : make sure to create a new 'users' directory (as follows) :

     cd /jnos ; mkdir users

   Sure - 'the software should do that for you' - but it doesn't right now.

   To create a password for your winlink callsign, use the following command :

     cd /jnos ; ./jnospwmgr -a <callsign> -w

   This is a first version, nothing fancy, but it works, it will evolve.

   IMPORTANT : the above password is internal to the Winlink challenge/response
   mechanism. You do NOT have to configure it anywhere else. You do NOT have to
   make ANY changes to the forward.bbs file for the new secure login protocol.

   If you didn't know it already, the password configured in forward.bbs for
   the 'wl2k' area is simply an application (client) validation password :)

3) There is an issue with TLD length in domain name lookups, and after doing a
   ton of reading on this topic, it appears JNOS is certainly not alone in it's
   failure to properly handle TLD lengths greater then 4. I have to be honest
   about this, it's complicated and everyone seems to have their own solution,
   so my interim solution for now is to allow the JNOS sysop to configure this
   to their own needs.

     Files : domain.c

   By default JNOS appends the 'domain suffix' value to DNS lookups containing
   a Top Level Domain (TLD) of length 4 or higher. I have added a new command
   to JNOS such that you can change this behavior. The command is as follows :

     domain TLDlen <tld length>

   Set <tld length> to -1 if you do not want anything appended on lookup.

4) added a log entry in the message refusal code, saying if msgid related, not
   a huge change at all, and I am still trying to figure out how to implement
   the indexing (GMT versus local time), not as easy as I figured, and I want
   to do it 'right'. I needed to get a version out, so I'm leaving the fix for
   a subsequent release.


 differences between 2.0j.7t and 2.0j.7s - June 29, 2015
 -------------------------------------------------------

1) The presence of a DKIM-Signature in a mail header also messes up the index
   rebuild of user mailboxes, so even though the previous version (7s) allowed
   one to finally read messages properly, the listing was still messed up.

     file : index.c

2) In the previous version (7s) I accidently included code where if JNOS does a
   domain name lookup while a message is being composed, and the lookup fails,
   JNOS will stop and not allow composition to continue, instead of passing it
   to an smtp gateway if one is configured - which is how it always worked.

     files changed : smtpcli.c

   The current code is not a perfect solution, a few users have brought up some
   interesting points. I should probably review the whole thing down the road.


 differences between 2.0j.7s and 2.0j.7r - June 6, 2015
 ------------------------------------------------------

1) JNOS can now attach a KISS port to FLDIGI - experimental, for example :

     # connection to fldigi is like AXUDP, using UDP port 10000
     attach axudp hf 256 192.168.1.174 ve4klm 10000 10000

     # then configure the port for FLDIGI KISS mode
     attach fldigi hf

   To use, #define FLDIGI_KISS in config.h - 'rm ax25.o config.o ; make'

     files changed : ax25.c, commands.h, config.c, makefile

          new file : fldigi.c

2) The presence of DKIM-Signature in the mail headers messes up the display of
   messages when a BBS user reads their messages, and also interferes with the
   processing of these messages. For instance, the 'Status: R' header entry is
   incorrectly written back to the users mail file. The DKIM-Signature contains
   blank lines, which usually indicate end of mail headers.

     files changed : bmutil.c

3) It appears bounce notification emails (mdaemon call) are being deleted by
   the default expiry feature, well before the expiry time. It turns out that
   the bounce notification emails are missing a RECEIVED mail header, which is
   required for proper indexing of the message. I figured this out after doing
   a rebuild of the mail users index, and noticing the age being set to 0.

     files changed : smtpserv.c

4) Now logging JNOS console (F10) commands to the main log file.

     files changed : main.c

   To use, #define JNOS_LOG_CONSOLE in config.h - 'rm main.o ; make'

5) The 'While talking to' line in failed mail notifications should identify the
   mail server JNOS was talking to, NOT the recipient domain. Also added a few
   preprocessor statements (#ifndef UNIX) with regard to the 'ft' variable, to
   clear up compiler warnings.

     files changed : smtpcli.c


 differences between 2.0j.7r and 2.0j.7q - March 17, 2015
 --------------------------------------------------------

   files changed : cmdparse.c, mailbox.c, tcpcmd.c, nr4.c, nr4timer.c
                   ip.h, config.h.default, version.c

   NOTE new config.h options below :

     #define SUBCMD_WASTEFULL_PROMPTING
     #define BLACKLIST_BAD_LOGINS
     #define TCPACCESS_EXPIRY

1) I have modified the tcp access function so one can now insert an entry
   anywhere into the 'table'. Before this, you could only add entries to the
   end of the 'table', so if you wanted to 'insert' a new record you would have
   to first delete the last one (or more), add your new one, then re-add the
   deleted one (or more). You might as well just have reconfigured your rules
   in the autoexec.nos, and then restarted JNOS instead. The new syntax is :

 tcp access <permit|deny|delete> [L#] <dest addr>[/<bits>] [lowport [highport]]

   Note the new OPTIONAL [L#] argument. So if you wanted to insert at the very
   top of the list, you would use L0. Use L1 if you wanted to go down 1 entry
   from the top, and so on. The # denotes depth from top, and note there is no
   space between the L and #. Other than that, the command remains the same.

   The L# option does NOT apply to the 'delete' function.

2) I get tons of telnet login attempts with user names like 'root', 'admin', or
   'sh', basically non-ham calls, so that got me thinking, why not give one the
   option of blacklisting the IP addresses responsible for these attempts, kind
   of like the sshblack script from years back, but JNOS style. All you have to
   do to enable the feature is use the following command :

     mbox blacklist N

   where N is a numerical value. 0 means no blacklisting, N is a time value in
   seconds after which the blacklist expires for any particular IP address. The
   expiry value is only relevant if you run the new tcp access expiry process,
   which is explained further below. If you don't run expiry, then of course
   the entries will stay till JNOS restarts, regardless of the value of N. The
   blacklist feature uses the newly added tcp access functionality to do its
   work - If you blacklist, you have to (at minimum) have the following :

     tcp access permit all

   The blacklist code inserts DENY rules prior to existing entries, so even if
   you are not using 'tcp access', at minimum you need the above default rule.

3) You can have JNOS expire blacklist entries at regular intervals. A new sub
   command has been added to 'tcp access' :

     tcp access expiry N

   where N is in minutes. If you don't run this, your blacklist will grow and
   grow and grow (nobody says you have to expire them, but your choice).

4) Example of autoexec.nos configuration for blacklisting with expiry :

     # blacklist must have minimum a 'permit all' entry
     tcp access permit all

     # blacklist bad logins for 15 minutes (900 seconds)
     mbox blacklist 900

     # run expiry process every 20 minutes
     tcp access expiry 20

5) Added some code to validate netrom callbacks before JNOS acts on them. I've
   discovered that JNOS crashes frequently when one starts tinkering with the
   netrom parameters. It turns out netrom callbacks disappear quite frequently
   if you play with the default parameters, but JNOS was not checking for it.

   These validation checks should significantly curb these incidents.

6) Instead of telling me that a particular console command 'takes at least
   one argument', quit wasting my time and just give me a list of possible
   arguments. This was driving me nuts for a long time. Not everyone will
   like it, but I do - '#undef SUBCMD_WASTEFULL_PROMPTING' if you don't.


 differences between 2.0j.7q and 2.0j.7p - February 18, 2015
 -----------------------------------------------------------

 * First of all, my apologies for leaving this so long, I really wanted to
   include the new 'tcp access' modifications and blacklisting of bad logins,
   but I'm not happy with the stability and command syntax at this time.

   files changed : mboxcmd.c, smtpserv.c, fbbfwd.c, forward.c, version.c

1) Added 'blacklist' subcommand to 'mbox' console command, allowing sysop to
   enable or disable the blacklisting of bad logins. I know that contradicts
   what I just mentioned above, but at this time it simply sets an internal
   variable, the main blacklist code is still not part of this release.

2) Commented out excessive debugging (JNOS log) in the SMTP code.

3) JNOS can now handle the 'A' and '!' FS response codes (which include file
   offset information). This is experimental, and difficult to test, so you
   should be warned - this will likely fail (at worst on a file seek error).

   dofbbrecv() never handled the FB proposal, not sure how that one got missed
   after all these years. This surfaced as a problem when I ran some forwarding
   tests with the linFBB software. It's fixed, so using N=1 on the linFBB side
   along with this fix greatly improves the linFBB forwarding experience.

4) I have noticed proposals are not being uppercased in the reverse forwarding
   code. I saw this in my JNOS log one day during a 'SP' forward session with
   another JNOS station. This had to be fixed - can't have JNOS uppercasing a
   proposal one way, then not doing it the other way. The choice was uppercase
   to keep in line with the historical usage from years back. This came up in
   recent discussions on whether MID/BID values should be case sensitive ...


 differences between 2.0j.7p and 2.0j.7 - January 29, 2015
 ---------------------------------------------------------

1) Reverted item number 3) introduced in the previous version 2.0j.7 (below).

   This so called 'fix' was seriously messing up FBB forwarding of messages
   containing CC recipients, so I had to revert back to the original code.

2) The basic JNOS installer and support files are now part of the JNOS source.
   (added to support my network based compile/install builder programs)

3) The '+' wildcard for the rewrite file never worked properly, that's fixed.
   (added february 4, 2015)


 differences between 2.0j.7 and 2.0j.6r - November 2, 2014
 ---------------------------------------------------------

1) For B2F delivery (fbbfwd.c), put in checks for missing email headers. In
   some cases, the To: and/or From: were missing, causing JNOS to crash !

2) More work on CCLIST issue (mboxmail.c) from 2.0j.5, one should check both
   the To: and CCLIST, not just the To: when looking for the presence of any
   external hosts in outgoing messages.

3) Moved the set_index() call for the TO field, from smtpserv.c to index.c, to
   fix a problem where users were reporting seeing the wrong TO information if
   they did a LIST command at their mailbox prompt. The index was 'wrong'.

4) The 'm->line' fixed length input buffer for mailbox is one step closer to
   being replaced with an unlimited length string input function and pointer
   combination - idea is to eventually do away with the fixed length buffer.

   Added a new module (ufgets.c), code is courtesy of btmills of GitHub, with
   some modifications to use it as a replacement for mbxrecvline() in the code
   where any BBS user issues the 'SC' command (mboxmail.c). Problems have been
   reported where the CCLIST is truncated and/or bleeds into the Subject line.

   This has to do with the way mbxrecvline() uses MBXLINE - using the ufgets()
   function instead completely fixes the reported problems, and allows for an
   'unlimited' number of CC recipients to be specified at the BBS prompt, no
   matter what the value of MBXLINE is.

5) The IGNORE_RIP_TAG option introduced in 2.0j.3 (search this document) was
   never added to the default config file (config.h.default). This option is
   somewhat important and should be more visible to people (default #undef).

6) Revamped the nos log functions, and added Bob's (VE3TOK) mods so that you
   can now specify a single running nos.log, instead of the daily versions,
   this is not a compile time option, decided to make it runtime instead,
   the new 'log' command usage is as follows :

     Usage: log file [ nos.log | daily ] THEN log [ on | off]
            disk logging is ON, logfile type is DDMMMYY (daily)

7) Regarding the rewrite file and matching of wildcards ?, *, and +. It's been
   noted only the * and + wildcards are providing the $1, $2, etc values, which
   one can refer to in the second column of a rule. JNOS has never set $1, $2,
   and so on for the ? wildcard tag. I have modified the code to now do this.

8) A request was made for a way to run a default expire on ALL mailboxes not
   listed in the 'expire.dat' configuration file. I have added new code which
   will allow you to do this. Simply add another line to 'expire.dat', but use
   the '*' character instead of a filename. That will be the default expire.

   If you decide to run a default expire, there may still be areas you do NOT
   want expiry done on, so an additional feature was added to deal with this
   very scenario. Any area for which you do NOT want default expiry done can
   be added to the 'expire.dat' file, with the age value set to -1.

   This feature actually opens up the possibility of using wildcards to expire
   files that have specific filename patterns, which would require a few more
   modifications to be made to the code, so for now that is just a thought.

9) Since early 2010, JNOS has been able to make use of RIP broadcasts from the
   AMPRnet gateways system, to update the ip routing table - an alternative to
   using the 'encap.txt' file method. Unfortunately, the code changes I did at
   the time to get this working, created a mutual exclusion of sorts. One could
   not do both RIPAMPRGW and regular RIP at the same time, it was either, or.

   This is now 'fixed' - you should now be able to use the usual RIP services
   provided by JNOS, while being able to handle the AMPRnet RIP broadcasts. Of
   course, you still have to define RIPAMPRGW, and use 'ip upstairs', etc.


 differences between 2.0j.6r and 2.0j.6q - July 21, 2014
 -------------------------------------------------------

1) Fixed a nasty bug, possibly related to the use of UTF-8 in the 'Subject:'
   field of an email header. I have noticed - a newline character seemingly
   out of place in the 'Subject:' field, can cause memory to be improperly
   allocated in the set_index() function, resulting in JNOS crashing.

   This was originally caught during the 'index <mailbox>' command, but the
   main culprit of our problems occurs when smtpserver() receives an email in
   which the above 'out of place newline' situation occurs.

   Rsync to your existing source directory, then run these commands :

     rm index.o version.o ; make


 differences between 2.0j.6q and 2.0j.6p - July 15, 2014
 -------------------------------------------------------

1) Accidently introduced a bug when fixing the CCLIST issue in point 9) of the
   version 2.0j.5 changes. I forgot to allocate an extra byte for a NULL string
   terminator, and we all know what that can do :) Using the SC command at the
   BBS prompt would result in JNOS crashing (not on all linux distributions).

   Rsync to your existing source directory, then run these commands :

     rm mboxmail.o version.o ; make


 differences between 2.0j.6p and 2.0j.5 - June 29, 2014
 -----------------------------------------------------

1) A very important fix to fbbfwd.c - an outgoing forward session where you
   connect using netrom (ie, 'netrom <call>' is used in a forward.bbs entry)
   could result in JNOS entering a 'race' condition (ie, the CPU usage goes
   up big time, and JNOS goes into an endless loop, and you have to kill it.

   The fix is actually the reinstatement of the code I had replaced back in
   October of 2009, a badly thought out idea now that I come to think of it.

   Rsync to your existing source directory, then run these commands :

     rm fbbfwd.o version.o ; make


 differences between 2.0j.5 and 2.0j.4 - June 18, 2014
 -----------------------------------------------------

 * For what it's worth, some of the changes noted here are actually a result of
   the recent work I've done on my Windows (WIN32) version of JNOS, highlighting
   at least one benefit of doing cross platform development of any software.
 
1) Fixed a bad mistake in the agwpe_send () function, after receiving a report
   from Mark (G7LTT) that it was not sending. He later confirmed (as I did) it
   is now working properly.

2) If you want to allow axudp from ANY source port, then use the value -1 for
   the optional UDP source port parameter in your axudp attach command. Make
   sure you tighten up the rules on which IP addresses are allowed - that has
   to be done at the firewall or ip access level. This 'feature' was added to
   deal with a situation encountered by Michael (N6MEF) - 2 JNOS systems, both
   behind a Sonicwall 'router' - UDP unreachable errors w.r.t axudp ports.

3) Improvements (if one wants to call them that) to the INP3 functionality :

     Fixed a bad typo, TT_HORIZON should be 60000, NOT 6000 !

     Added ability to better configure INP3 functionality, sysop needs to be
     able to maintain a list of INP3 capable stations for which we'll actually
     use INP3 with, instead of blinding doing INP3 with every netrom interface
     we have on the system. A new jnos console command added for this :

         usage : inp ifaces *[if1 if2 if3 ... ifN]

     The badly thought out 'vhf' kludge is removed - I had forgot about it.

     Several people have remarked INP3 is very agressive, so I have reduced
     the value of the ROOT_QUALITY from 254, to 230 as an experiment.

     Added some overflow checks, and warning messages - I still have to figure
     out how to deal with some of those situations - I don't know right now.

4) A bit of an overhaul to the SNMP service, rewriting portsion of this code
   has actually helped me to fully understand how SNMP works and some of the
   fundamental ideas behind it's design. In short, it's up to a querying tool
   to recognize if the results of an snmpwalk lie outside the area of interest
   or have crossed a MIB boundary, simple enough, work completed on 04May2014.

   The process name is now 'snmpd', used to be 'SNMP listener'.

   Had to add GetNextRequest PDU, it's fundamental to walk operations.

   Added several more MIBS, so one can now snmpwalk JNOS with any MIB, the
   worse case scenario is JNOS will return an 'out of bounds' for any item or
   group of items it can not provide any information for - try these out :

        snmpwalk -v1 -c jnos ve4klm.ampr.org ifName
        snmpwalk -v1 -c jnos ve4klm.ampr.org ifDesc
        snmpwalk -v1 -c jnos ve4klm.ampr.org ifInOctets
        snmpwalk -v1 -c jnos ve4klm.ampr.org ifOutOctets

   Finally, you can now configure your MRTG using ifaceName instead of the
   offset, meaning if you add or remove a JNOS interface, you no longer have
   to reindex your iface entries in the MRTG config file. For instance :

        Target[encap]: #encap:jnos@192.168.1.201:

   instead of  :

        Target[encap]: 14:jnos@192.168.1.201:

   See how the index '14' is replaced by the iface name 'encap'. You must
   use the '#' character, which tells MRTG it is using iface name instead.

   Important - make sure you add the line 'NoMib2:yes' to your mrtg.cfg !!!

5) A technical fix that most people may not even notice. For B2F forwarding, I
   have added some code from Lantz to better format the 'From: ' field in the
   message header. Up till now, nowhere in JNOS did one ever check for " or <
   delimiters - the assumption being that the 'From:' field would always be of
   the simplistic form, 'name@company.com' - not true in todays day and age.

   Also to stay consistent with 'From' we get from older style FBB systems, I
   now strip off the '%' portion, like I already do for the '@' portion.

6) Fixed a big problem which surfaced whenever JNOS tried to forward to another
   station where JNOS had to first connect to an Xnet node, and then connect to
   the other station from there. JNOS would receive the Xnet prompt, but then
   just sit there and eventually timeout. The problem too, was nothing would
   show up in the JNOS log, and nobody would know why this was happening.

   It turns out the Xnet station in question did not send a CR at the end of
   it's prompt, which the JNOS code depends on. I have modified the forwarding
   code and script to accomodate the lack of a CR in the prompt. One should now
   be able to forward without any issues. I also added a bit more debugging to
   the JNOS log to give the sysop a better idea of what's going on.

7) Added basic functionality to capture WINMOR calls heard on HF, so one can
   now display a 'heard list' of sorts, by using a new jnos console command :

       hfdd heard

   Even though it's a general hfdd command, only WINMOR is tracked right now.

   Also fixed a problem with the general hfdd connect flag and how it was being
   set incorrectly on a disconnect state, causing inconsistent operations.

8) Big improvement to the HFDD code in general - waiting for an HFDD connection
   to terminate is very important in how a forwarding session ends. This never
   did work properly. For instance, forwarding sessions (winmor, pactor) would
   either hang, or be cutoff before they could finish up properly, resulting in
   JNOS itself hanging or worse, crashing, and things just got very bad :(

   This latest code actually waits (up to 3 minutes) for a disconnect, and my
   most recent tests show this is working so much better then before. I've had
   several great WINMOR sessions to test this out with (with live HF systems),
   and I think it is a major improvement to the overal hfdd code.

9) A new jnos console command to configure how 'To:' is set in the mail hdr :

       mbox rewriteToHdr [ on | off ]

   Since me maintaining JNOS and before 2004, JNOS has always set the TO field
   in any message header, to be the original (pre rewrite file) value. I added
   this option so that people can have a post rewrite file value instead, sort
   of requested by Michael (N6MEF) when he 'discovered' a CCLIST issue, which
   required a bit of reorganization and some new code to be put into place.

   If set, this option forces the mail header to be set from 'm->to', instead
   of the default 'm->origto' (if that value is actually set). The default is
   no rewrite of the TO header (to stay consistent with older JNOS versions).

   Fixed a CCLIST issue where if one is sending to both local and internet
   email addresses at the same time (CC one or more, TO the other), then the
   external smtp service getting the message sees a local address (ie, ve4klm)
   without a host name, and automatically appends the hostname of the domain
   being handled by that external smtp service. The end result is one or more
   incorrect email addresses showing up in the headers of mail recipients.

10) Outgoing ax25 packets for kiss and/or slip type devices are now recorded
    properly for the SNMP server. I forgot to include the code way back when.

11) Checking for NULL ax25 callback structure in axip code to prevent crash.

12) Added some socket validity checks, hopefully this reduces the occurance of
    the infamous JNOS crash which happens quite frequency when a user uses the
    jnos console command, 'mbox reset <call>'. Ironically, I discovered these
    validity situations while working on my windows version of JNOS 2.0 - the
    visual studio debugger nailed these situations instantly and accurately.

13) Adding support to MultiPSK driver for incoming connects, this is not quite
    complete, still experimental. A new function to compare strings but ignore
    the white space while doing so. A new function to send command directives
    to the MultiPSK software modem. JNOS will now look for incoming connects
    on MultiPSK and launch a mailbox if a connect is 'detected'. The idea is
    to be able to connect to JNOS via 'any' keyboard mode.

14) Bumped up stack size for the telnet MBOX server, was 2K, it's now 8K !

15) A new TCP watch dog of sorts, I have noticed a lot of SYN attacks towards
    various ports on JNOS, and so this is an attempt to reset TCB entries stuck
    in a SYN RECEIVED or FIN WAIT state for longer then they 'should be'. The
    question is - what is an acceptable amount of time to wait for ? The idea
    of this is to make sure JNOS does not 'run out out resources'. I actively
    use this feature on my production system and it helps by the looks of it.

    This is experimental, the new jnos console command is :

        tcp watch <interval in seconds>

    Another suggestion is to use existing jnos console commands like these :

        mbox tdisc 120
        smtp tdisc 120

    to make sure 'broken' or 'malicious' login and smtp attempts are not left
    sitting there forever (which can contribute to JNOS using up resources).

16) I have been experimenting with limiting the number of processes spawned by
    JNOS when it receives a flurry of requests for a particular TCP service,
    the idea (again) being to protect JNOS from running out of resources. It
    is experimental, is part of this release, but not defined (MAXTASKS) at
    this time, needs more work - using pop3serv() as the 'test subject' :)

17) Other minor things, cleaning up debugs, cleaning up JNOS log entries, etc.

 introduced 2.0j.X on November 12, 2013
 --------------------------------------

1) Version 2.0j.X is 'on the edge', it is from my development system, and has
   the potential to change at moments notice. I use it to get updates out to
   specific people who are helping me fix bugs or test software changes.


 differences between 2.0j.4 and 2.0j.3 - September 14, 2013
 ----------------------------------------------------------

1) JNOS can finally handle incoming B1F protocol, as well as the 'H', 'R',
   and 'E' values that might show up in an FS response from a remote system.
   Sorry, but offset values are not supported at this time, quite frankly I
   have never seen one (yet), and if one does show up JNOS will most likely
   report a protocol error. IF this happens, I ask that you notify me, and
   I will deal with it then. This fix means you will likely never need to
   use the 'mbox nob2f <call>' command again. There is no mbox fbb level
   implemented (yet) for JNOS to prompt B1F when remote systems connect.

   modified files : fbbfwd.c, forward.c, mailbox.[ch], mboxmail.c

   JNOS never could handle an SID specifying the B1F protocol, but it was
   never a problem because for incoming connects JNOS would always present
   the remote client with BF, and for outgoing connects even to B1F capable
   systems like FBB, JNOS could only go as high as BF, so all was good.

   Until I introduced B2F ! Without realizing it at the time, any B1F capable
   system (like FBB) that connected to a B2F capable JNOS would respond back
   with a B1F, which JNOS would mistakenly treat as a BF. They are not the
   same (B1F contains an additional checksum). A typical symptom of this was
   JNOS going into a high CPU loop, generating massive temporary files which
   never seemed to stop growing, and JNOS simply slowing down (hanging).

   I can't even recall if the problem existed the other way. Anyways the
   'mbox nob2f <callsign>' command was created to try and deal with this
   issue, but I suspect many people were not aware of it, even though it
   is mentioned in this file - differences between 2.0j and 2.0i, back
   on March 20, 2012, take a look at point 15) under that section.


 differences between 2.0j.3 and 2.0j.2 - August 6, 2013
 ------------------------------------------------------

1) Added code to expire messages dated in the future - however, by default it
   will not do so unless you enable it using a newly added 'future' argument to
   the existing 'expire' command. The new syntax for 'expire' is as follows :

      expire [ <interval in hours> | now | future [ yes | no ] ]

   modified file : expire.c

2) Specific to Winlink, added code such that if a BBS user prepends 'smtp:' to
   the recipient of a message when using the SP command, JNOS sets up the FROM
   and MSGID mail headers to ensure Winlink delivers the email to 3rd parties.

   For example :

     sp smtp:maiko@pcs.mb.ca

   This 'feature' requires an entry in the rewrite file. Please refer to the
   brand new documentation (under practical guide) on how to setup JNOS with
   the Winlink CMS Telnet servers.

   modified file : mboxmail.c

3) JNOS ignores RIP routes 'tagged' other then IPIP, but there may be cases
   where the tag is not being set properly by the system originating the RIP
   broadcasts, resulting in JNOS ignoring all the RIP route broadcasts. If
   this is the case then add the following to config.h, remove rip.o, and
   recompile JNOS using the 'make' command :

     #define IGNORE_RIP_TAG	/* Gus (I0OJJ) this one's for you :) */

   modified file : rip.c

4) Specific to Multipsk, I am working on code that will allow any HF user to
   connect to JNOS using ANY keyboard mode supported by Multipsk, even morse
   code. This is very experimental, and a bit radical I think. Station costs
   and simplicity are the motivating factors behind my desire to try it out.

   Imagine if QRP or weak signal digital stations could connect to JNOS using
   cw, mfsk16, or digital modes, and read or send simple messages to users on
   the internet or other systems. It may be slow, but accessible to most.

   Multipsk is a great piece of software, the interface (API) supports this.

   The original idea actually came to me when I was frustrated with my mobile
   packet in my car only working up to 5 miles away. We no longer have packet
   infrastructure around Winnipeg anymore, so I wonder if perhaps weak signal
   is the way to go. I'm sure I can get much better then 5 miles, but I have
   to write this code first, then test it and see how far I can push it.

   Note : I am not just targeting the HF band here, VHF/UHF weak signal ?

   modified file : multipsk.c        (ongoing changes)

5) My development version of JNOS is using dlmalloc (version 2.8.0 by Doug Lea)
   for over a year now, instead of the malloc that comes with GNU. It's working
   quite well, but is NOT part of this release - if you are interested, let me
   know, and I'll pass on the code (it's very simple to integrate into JNOS).

6) I have been experimenting with 'speeding up the tick', simply by changing
   the value of MTICK in timer.h from 55 to no less then 10 - below that and
   JNOS starts to 'fall apart'. Quite some time ago I rewrote the TICK code,
   to see how much further I could take this, but it got out of control, so I
   shelved the idea. I might go back to it again sometime in the future.

   If you want to enable the timer.h change, add the following to config.h :

     #define SPEED_UP_TICK	/* Gus (I0OJJ) this one's for you :) */

   then remove a few objects files, and recompile JNOS as follows :

     rm domain.o main.o rspf.o timer.o unix.o
     make

   modified file : timer.h

7) I have been experimenting with the JNOS kernel, trying to impose the concept
   of process priority on the JNOS user space threads, results are not great at
   this point, so it is NOT part of this release, and remains experimental.


 differences between 2.0j.2 and 2.0j.1 - April 29, 2012
 ------------------------------------------------------

1) Fixed another bug in the white page code, see following for details :

      www.langelaar.net/projects/jnos2/downloads/linux/patch_20j2.txt
      www.langelaar.net/projects/jnos2/downloads/linux/patch_20j2.tar

   Important : Apply this patch only on top of 2.0j.1 !


 differences between 2.0j.1 and 2.0j - April 26, 2012
 ----------------------------------------------------

1) Fixed a serious bug in the white page code, see following for details :

      www.langelaar.net/projects/jnos2/downloads/linux/patch_20j1.txt
      www.langelaar.net/projects/jnos2/downloads/linux/patch_20j1.tar

   Important : Apply this patch only on top of 2.0j !

   Also available is brand new (quite detailed and absolutely up to date
   with the latest efforts) documentation of the JNOS white page support.

      www.langelaar.net/projects/jnos2/documents/practical/wpages


 differences between 2.0j and 2.0i - March 20, 2012
 --------------------------------------------------

1) Decided it was time to make a new tar file (new official release). It has
   been over a year, so time to put everything into one easy download again.

   Included is the beginnings of 'White Pages' support, the database portion
   of the code is taken from Lantz TNOS 2.40 source code. I thought it makes
   sense to use his code and give it a try - no point re-inventing wheels.

2) I have defined a standard on how JNOS version numbers are to be done :

   As of now, the version of JNOS 2.0 will be defined as follows :
  
     JNOS 2.0x.n
  
   where 'x' is a small LETTER, and 'n' is a sequence NUMBER. For a new
   official release (read below), there is NO sequence number present.
  
   The small LETTER will be bumped up each time I decide to put out a new
   tar file (a new official release) for those who do not (or can not) use
   the RSYNC protocol to get the official source code off my system.
  
   Any changes (no matter how small) made to an official release must have
   a sequence NUMBER included in the version. Further more, this NUMBER must
   be incremented each time a change is made to any of the JNOS 2.0 source.
   
   This new standard will be strongly adhered to from this point on !

 *** February 27, 2012 ***

3) New console command, 'snmp', to display 'interface # to name' mappings, so
   one can easier configure their mrtg.cfg file. Before, you had to guess or
   count your autoexec.nos attaches to find out the interface # to use. Now
   you can dump it to your screen, which should make your life easier.

   It would be nice if one could use the port name (ie, #tun0) in mrtg.cfg
   instead of an interface #, but it's too much trouble (at this time) to
   implement the necessary functionality into the JNOS SNMPD code.

4) Big news - new TCP/IP client for AGW Packet Engine !!!

   Check under documents / online practical guide / soundmodems - link is :

  http://www.langelaar.net/projects/jnos2/documents/practical/#softwaremodems

5) Confirmed that Thomas Sailer's soundmodem still works with JNOS - It works
   very well - as a matter of fact I used two JNOS 2.0 systems talking to each
   other, one was connected to AGW PE running on a MS Vista PC, the other using
   the latest soundmodem-0.16 driver. Radio channels were simulated using good
   old fashioned desktop speakers and microphones.

   I compiled soundmodem from source, which is available at this site below :

      http://www.baycom.org/~tom/ham/soundmodem/

 *** January 30, 2012 ***

6) Sometimes JNOS is run in an xterm window, instead of on a linux console. If
   the xterm window is resized, a 'NOS PANIC: Lost keyboard' error will result
   in JNOS, and it will kill itself in the process.

   I have created a fix which *seems* to handle the situation in a much better
   manner now. Instead of terminating, JNOS will keep running and simply adjust
   to the new number of columns and rows. The event is now logged to the JNOS
   log, not to the screen as before. Please report any issues - thank you.

7) It was reported that history recall using the UP and DOWN arrow keys was
   not working. In fact, it does work, but is dependant on the value of the
   TERM environment variable. It works perfectly fine if 'TERM=linux', but
   for cases where 'TERM=xterm', JNOS does not have the code to be able to
   handle the 3 byte key sequence sent to it by the linux kernel.

   I have added a mapping function to handle this, so you should now be able
   to use the UP and DOWN arrow keys for history recall, for JNOS running in
   an xterm or other terminal type using the ANSI escape sequences.

 *** December 17, 2011 ***

8) Better support for PTY98 (/dev/ptmx, /dev/pts/N) pseudo devices. Bob (VE3TOK)
   asked for this a long time ago, so I figured I better get it implemented.

   Note : Technically one can use the new jnos 'attach baycom' and go direct to
   a kernel KISS type interface, meaning you don't need to run an intermediary
   program (kissattach or net2kiss) anymore. Try it, let me know how it works.

   COMPILE : Make sure '#define JNOSPTY98' exists in your config.h file.

   The best way for me to show how this feature works is by example. One way of
   getting JNOS to use a linux AX25 device is through the 'kissattach' program,
   but get the one from F6BVP (it has a mod that actually outputs the name of
   the slave device after you run the program). The stock ax25 utilities will
   not tell you that (you have to look for a new /dev/pts/N to appear then).

      kissattach /dev/ptmx radio > /jnos/spool/ptmx_radio.cfg

   The issue here is you don't know what slave device you will get, it could
   change each time you run kissattach, there may be no consistent device name
   for you to depend on when running 'attach asy' in the JNOS autoexec.nos.

   Now in JNOS (autoexec.nos), suppose we have this entry below :

      attach asy ptmx_radio - ax25 ax0 4096 256 9600

   I have added a feature where if the 3rd argument starts with 'ptmx_', then
   JNOS will look for a corresponding *.cfg file, and extract the slave device
   name from it, and then attach using that instead of the original argument.

9) New SMTP gateway options, the old way just didn't work for alot of people,
   it would first try to deliver direct to a host, then to MX if enabled, and
   finally to an smtp gateway (as a last resort) if you have one configured.

   COMPILE : Make sure '#define SGW_EXCEPTIONS' exists in your config.h file.

   Two (2) new subcommands have been added to the smtp gateway syntax :

       smtp ga mode [original|force|first|last]

       smtp ga exception add ip mask
       smtp ga exception delete ip mask
       smtp ga exception  (to list)

   The original way to define the gateway has not changed :

       smtp ga [A.B.C.D | none]

   If mode is not configured, then JNOS will function the old way.

   The 'force' mode sends ALL smtp requests direct to the gateway,
   nothing is sent direct to a host, and no MX records are tried.

   The 'first' mode does the same, but allows for exceptions, of
   which are configured using the 'smtp ga exception' subcommand.

   Exceptions basically follow the old way, BUT the gateway will
   not be attempted as a last resort if all else fails.

   Why have a 'force' ? Perhaps you are running 'first' with a
   list of exceptions, and for some reason you need to force all
   traffic to a gateway without having to reconfigure everything.

   The 'last' option does not do anything, and 'original' simply
   switches back to old way - I doubt anyone will use those two.

   Example (this is what I am currently running on my system) :

    smtp ga A.B.C.D

    smtp t4 60          # 1 minute timeout

    smtp ga mode first

    # send everything to gateway except 44 stations, they go direct
    smtp ga exception add 44.0.0.0 0xff000000

    # other exceptions (examples) - you can have as many as you want
    smtp ga exception add E.F.G.0  0xffffff00
    smtp ga exception add X.Y.Z.Z  0xffffffff

   Alot of this functionality actually comes from the 'SMTP Deny Relay
   Exceptions' code (SDRE), which I wrote some time ago. I was able to
   use the same code for this enhancement (with some restructing).

 *** October 2, 2011 ***

10) I am once again working on the INP support, which I last worked on quite a
    few years ago (as far back as 2005). I've been asked to make it work again,
    so it's back on the plate - a READ ONLY version of INP is now available.

    Please refer to the following NEW document which details the work so far :

      http://www.langelaar.net/projects/jnos2/documents/inp2011.txt

11) Fixed up SNMP, there were no incoming counts for the axip/axudp interfaces,
    and JNOS now tracks counts for the netrom interface. Even though all of the
    changes were quite trivial, I spent two days on it - the new INP code seems
    to have pushed the network() daemon stack size to the limit - even 1 or 2
    lines of new SNMP code was enough to push JNOS into a stack overflow. For
    example, if netrom debug was on, any incoming RIF frames would crash JNOS
    when it tried to write to the logfile. I have bumped up the stack size of
    the network() daemon to 4096 if INP2011 is defined - problem solved !

 *** April 28th and before ***

12) Looks like I forgot to put in the rewrite code for B2F forwarding, noticed
    that bulletins were not going to the proper areas. Thank you to Gus (I0OJJ)
    for running forwarding tests with my system, and noticing this problem. As
    well, corrected a 'problem' where the 'From: ' header in messages coming in
    from a forward session had too much information (suffix of origbbs). I did
    this to be consistent with regular BF forwarding (FA proposal) format. We
    will have to see if anyone complains about this one.

13) Started work on a new SNMP server for JNOS in mid December, the idea being
    that I want to use MRTG graphs to directly monitor my JNOS interfaces, and
    see what kind of traffic I am getting. By the start of February, I finally
    got something that works very much to my expectations. Check the practical
    user guide for full details.

    Warning - you MUST do a MASS compile, since the 'iface' structure has been
    altered from previous versions - I have added additional member variables,
    and the code will change over the next while as I secure and fine tune it.

14) It would appear that B2F forwarding between two JNOS 2.0i systems was not
    working - messages were always rejected. This is fixed, the FA proposal hack
    usually seen in the log is now gone, and the FC proposal is properly dealt
    with now. It's pretty cool to watch two JNOS systems B2F forwarding.

15) If your JNOS is B2F enabled, any forwarding partners connecting to you and
    showing a SID of B1F are now immediately disconnected to prevent possible
    damage to user mailbox files and keep JNOS 2.0i stable. There is an issue
    with how JNOS treats B1F (it doesn't), but this issue is only relevant if
    you are running B2F (mbox fbb 3). The JNOS log will tell you how to get
    around the problem for now - ie, the 'mbox nob2f <call>' solution.

16) I have added a new 'nos_log_peerless()' function, so I can log to the JNOS
    log for UDP servers like the new snmpd.c just added. I never really liked
    the fact that the regular log always displayed a '-', when I wanted to see
    an <ip address:port> instead. The regular log uses 'j2getpeername()' to get
    that information, but it fails for sockets using SOCK_DGRAM mode. Also, if
    the regular log is passed -1 for socket, there's no point going through the
    entire user socket list when we know it won't be found - wastes cpu/time.

17) Fixed up the domain name resolving code for axudp and axip interfaces that
    have a domain name configured for their remote host. Up till now, if JNOS
    was not able to resolve the domain name of the remote host at the time of
    the attach, the interface would not get created. No more - the interface
    will now be created, even if the remote host ip address can not be found,
    the idea being that eventually it will get resolved - in the meantime,
    the interface will just get ignored till it becomes active.

    This new method gives a consistent order to the JNOS interfaces, something
    which the recent SNMPD + MRTG work relies quite heavily on. Lastly, there's
    no more need to use the 'at' command to attach the 'dyndns' type interfaces
    a few minutes after JNOS has finished loading the autoexec.nos file. Just
    attach them like you would any other interface in your autoexec.nos file.

18) JNOS will now properly link if you '#undef WINMOR', previously the make
    process would continue to look for winmor function references, and fail.


differences between JNOS 2.0i and 2.0h - November 23, 2010
----------------------------------------------------------

1) Some people like to customize their 'config.h' file. There have been some
   cases where people updated their source (mostly via the rsync server), only
   to have their customized 'config.h' file wiped out. For that reason alone,
   from this point on, JNOS 2.0 source will no longer ship with a 'config.h',
   instead it will contain a file called 'config.h.default'.

   The makefile checks for 'config.h'. If it does not exist (as is the case of
   a fresh install), it will first copy 'config.h.default' to 'config.h', then
   do the compile. If you want to customize 'config.h' before you do a compile
   on a fresh install, run the command 'make defconfig' first, which creates
   the 'config.h', then customize (edit) it, then run 'make' after that, to
   do the actual compile. Also note, 'hardware.h' is no more - it's gone !

   If you choose to use a config.h from a previous JNOS compile, you may want
   to run a diff between it and config.h.default to see if you are missing out
   on any new features. Technically speaking, you should be able to use the
   original JNOS (linux) 1.11f config.h file, but I have not tried that.

   Added a few fixes and mods from K6FSH, check 'readme.k6fsh' for details. I
   have put his original patch file and docs in a 'k6fsh' subdirectory.

2) If you have the Intel Compiler (icc) Version 11.0, it will compile JNOS too,
   all you need to do is change the following in the makefile :

      change 'CC = gcc' to 'CC = icc'

      comment out 'DEBUG = -g3

   The '-g3' option can cause an unresolved reference at link time. This is a
   known problem due to a bug in the kernel headers, not the compiler. I did
   this on a Scientific Linux 5.4 system (x86_64) - it runs fine, tun works,
   you will probably see a fair amount of compiler warnings - no worries.

3) Fixed the famous '25 day negative timer' issue. Around the 24 to 25 day
   mark, timers would suddenly stop working, showing negative values, etc.

   Thanks go out to Jack (AA6HF) for pushing me on this and for testing.

4) New feature, added syncing (flushing) of trace log files. This is a feature
   which should have been added a long time ago. The problem with tracing to a
   file has always been that the operating system only flushes to disk every so
   often (which makes sense of course), but if one wants to depend on the file
   for realtime monitoring, it's not practical. By syncing the log file every
   few seconds or milliseconds (user selectable), it now becomes practical.

   The 'trace' command now features an extra parameter (in milliseconds), for
   example, to trace port ax0 to file, and flush it to disk every 1/2 second :

      trace ax0 0x211 ax0.log 500

   A big thanks to Michael (N6MEF) for pushing me on this, and for testing.

   Warning - you MUST do a MASS compile, since the 'iface' structure has been
   altered from previous versions - I have added additional member variables.

5) Interface names (not descriptions) can now be any length. One could always
   create interfaces with long names, but they would not work (port could not
   be found, or error 22, etc). This required redefinition of the sockaddr_ax
   structure - look for '#ifdef JNOS20_SOCKADDR_AX' in the code if curious.

6) Added callsign validation for the web (browser) based user mailbox. I forgot
   to add it, and was seeing garbage logins from time to time. Now only *valid*
   callsigns will be accepted when users try to login via the browser. Session
   control code has also been substantially improved. In the original version,
   simple internet probes or DOS attacks quickly max'd out available sessions.

   New command :

      hvs

7) JNOS is able to B2F forward with an RMS Packet Node. I'm quite happy with
   how well it is working, so much that I now do hourly connects to a nearby
   RMS Packet Node to check for any mail destined to VE4KLM from Winlink, or
   if I have messages destined to preconfigured users on the Winlink system.

8) Experimental interface to another PC running WINMOR Sound Card Modem. Spent
   a few months on this starting in April 2010. During the course of this work,
   some major refinements were made to the B2F code. My remote test system was
   another PC running both RMS Express + WINMOR Sound Card Modem. JNOS talked
   to it via audio cables, speakers, and microphone - simulated RF channel :)

   New commands :

      hfdd ip [ip address of tnc]*

   RMS Express is now able to connect to JNOS and pick up messages, as well as
   send us messages (with attachments) during the same forwarding session. This
   should still be considered experimental - alot more testing, particularly
   exception testing, still needs to be done.

   The WINMOR 'define' is now in 'config.h.default', used to be in 'makefile'.

9) More refinements to the B2F and general FBB forwarding code. Uncompressed
   and Compressed size values in outgoing FC proposals are no longer faked out,
   and a proper checksum is now appended to any outgoing F> messages. The fake
   values and missing checksum would result in RMS Express crashing each time.
   
   Here's another good one - code I wrote in 2005 to disable FBBCMP after an
   hfdd_connect() actually contributed to a whole slew of problems with the B2F
   forwarding code. I have since removed the code, solving several key issues.

   It would appear that JNOS - even before version 1.11f - has been replying to
   an incoming FQ with it's own outgoing FQ. I don't believe that is correct,
   so I have removed that function. Not sure if it will fix anything or not. I
   would guess having the additional FQ could disrupt a forwarding session in
   certain cases, but that I don't know at this time.

10) JNOS can now use RIP broadcasts from the AMPRnet gateways system, instead
    of the 'encap.txt' file, to update the ip routing table. The RIP stuff has
    been available since early 2010. It's an alternative, not a replacement.

    New commands :

      ip upstairs [multicast ip address]

11) A BBS user can now connect to a remote station without having their SSID
    inverted. Instead of CONNECT, they can use the new CONNISC command. Same
    syntax as the CONNECT command. I did it mostly to ensure the Winlink RMS
    Packet node uses the *proper* callsign when logging into Winlink to check
    for the BBS users messages - CALL and CALL-15 are two different users !

    New command :

      connisc

12) More cleanup of main log file, more 64 bit compatibility changes (nothing
    too serious, just want to make sure stuff is done right), and fix compiler
    warnings on various platforms (not just slackware or redhat derivatives).

13) The 'available memory' and 'core memory left' information has been removed
    from all the various stats displays, mostly for technical reasons. Available
    memory logged when JNOS first starts up is far from accurate anyways, and I
    have never found this information to be terribly useful on linux versions.

    Note : This *might* affect scripts you have that depend on stats info.

14) JNOS can now run as a daemon (no keyboard, no (n)curses, no console), all
    you need to do is '#define HEADLESS' near the top of your config.h file,
    and do a 'make clean', then 'make'. I should provide a separate makefile
    for this that has NO references to the CURSES stuff - will do so later.

15) The INFO command was never really updated to reflect all the stuff I've
    added over the years since the JNOS 2.0 project started. I'll try and do
    better in keeping the 'version.c' file uptodate. This is ongoing ...

16) Got rid of the '-more-' prompt when a mailbox user logs in through their
    web browser and tries to list or read long messages. There is no point in
    having a prompt with a browser interface. It is a big pain in the neck.

    Thank you to Gustavo (I0OJJ) for his perseverance on this issue.

17) Fixed a problem reported by Robert (KD1ZD) where JNOS would crash when
    trying to get the mailbox name (mbx_getname). The code was not checking
    to make sure a connection actually existed before moving on. The code
    will now log a message 'connection never completed' if this happens.


differences between JNOS 2.0h and 2.0g - December 6, 2009
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Time to turn the latest beta into an official version - JNOS 2.0h 

   The uptime on my 32 bit test system (pentium 100, x86, Slackware (9.1), uses
   a baycom board for RF port) has exceeded 31 days, and is very stable, lots of
   forwarding and smtp going on to test it. I'm very comfortable with it.

   The uptime on my 64 bit test system (optiplex 330, x86_64, Arch (aug/2009),
   uses a kiss enabled PacComm TINY-2 MK-2 for RF port) has exceeded 18 days,
   and also seems quite stable, with lots of forwarding and smtp going on.

2) This release is supposed to be 64 bit compatible. In other words, it does
   not care if the linux box you are using is x86 or x86_64 architecture. It
   does not care if you use Slackware 9.1, Arch 2009, or Fedora Core 11.

3) WARNING - IF you are migrating a JNOS installation from a 32 bit system. In
   other words, if you are copying /jnos from your 32 bit environment to run it
   in your new 64 bit environment, you MUST reindex your mail/spool files !!!

   One way to do this is to run jnos with the -i option. You only have to do
   it once. This is very important to do. The *.IND files are binary files,
   and are platform dependent, so your 32 bit index files will *seem* corrupt
   and do all sorts of strange things, possibly hanging and/or crashing JNOS
   in the process.

   I had hoped to make the index files platform independent, but that will have
   to wait for a subsequent release. So for now, please REINDEX your files !!!

4) Big new feature, web (browser) based user mailbox. Users can now use their
   favorite web browser to access the JNOS 2.0 BBS. It has the exact same look
   and feel of a telnet or ax25 connect, but you use your web browser intead.

5) Otherwise, no new features have been added. Some entries in the JNOS log
   have been cleaned up a bit, for instance the dyndns processing for axudp
   and axip interfaces has been minimalized to just a one line entry.

6) NOTE - JNOS 2.0h compiles fine with the *shipped* 'config.h' file ...

   IF you decide to edit config.h to suit your own needs, you *might* get
   compile errors. I can not possibily test all the different combinations
   of options in config.h, so there is always the chance that you may run
   into problems. IF so, please contact me - maiko@pcs.mb.ca - to fix it.


differences between JNOS 2.0g and 2.0f - May 26, 2009
-----------------------------------------------------

1) Time to put out another official release, it's been well over a year
   since the last one. I really need (want) to get 64 bit compatibility
   completed. Having an official release (instead of ongoing betas) will
   make it easier for me to do the work and manage the changes.

   In other words - JNOS 2.0 is still not 64 bit compatible !

   I have compiled and run JNOS 2.0 on a Dell Optiplex 745 (x86_64) machine
   running Scientific Linux 5.3, but things do not behave properly, and it
   looks like the compile is now a 64 bit thing.

   Earlier versions of Scientific Linux did not give me these problem. If you
   run into the same problem that I did, you can try to add the '-m32' option
   to the gcc command, which forces applications to compile in 32 bit mode.

   You will need to install gcc-multilib, or the equivalent for your O/S, but
   be warned. In the case of Scientific Linux 5.3, installing 32 bit support
   for gcc, glibc, etc is very difficult - a pain, and possibly impossible!
 
2) Support for the B2F forwarding protocol, including attachments.

   Important - B2F support is #undef'd in the config.h file distributed with
   this release, since most JNOS systems will never interact with Airmail or
   Winlink, and using B2F between 2 jnos systems likely is of no benefit.

3) A B2F exclusion list for stations that can't handle B2F forwarding.

4) Support for 'Y','N', and 'L' codes in responses to FBB proposals, since
   previously JNOS only supported the original set of '+', '-', and '='.

5) Properly handle telnet (internet access) connections from Airmail clients.

6) Created an exception (SDRE) list for 'SMTP DENY RELAY' - very useful !

   Added a new 'NoRelay' string for when JNOS sends a 'DENY RELAY' response,
   which replaces the use of the 'Unknown' string used prior to this, giving
   a more accurate indication of the situation, instead of confusing users.

7) Included mods by N8CML (Ronald Schubot) - added new routines to properly
   remove dynamic gateway entries, something I failed to address when I had
   originally wrote the RTDYNGWROUTE code.

8) Direct BAYCOM driver (linux only) - NET2KISS and PSEUDO-TTY are no longer
   needed for JNOS to talk to a Baycom Board - we now go direct to kernel !

   The baycom support is #undef'd in the config.h file distributed with this
   release, since it requires the presence of kernel headers and source, as
   well as baycom kernel module support. I developed this on a Slackware 9.1
   system, which came with all of that - it runs very nicely on my system.

9) MultiPsk support - JNOS can now connect to MultiPsk (tcp/ip server), and
   use MultiPsk as a digital modem - at this time, for packet (AX25) only.

10) New Hostmode (PACTOR) driver for the PK-232MBX (pakratt 232) AEA modem,
    including broadcast of FEC (cq cq cq de call call call) text.

11) Two critical fixes to the HFDD code, something that has plagued me ever
     since I started the HFDD type of interface. This is VERY significant !

   a) If you attach any HFDD type interface to JNOS (even if you don't use
      it - just attaching it), chances are smtp would crash each time it was
      required. In later betas, the crash would be replaced with a warning
      to the log, and your smtp queue would simply grow, nothing would ever
      get delivered, until you restarted JNOS without the HFDD interface.

      Any code that attaches ANY interface, must use 'setencap()' so that
      the tcp parameters are properly initialized. Failure to do so causes
      a crash in the tcpuser.c module.

   b) Figured out why HF sessions with Airmail on ANY type of HF modem would
      disconnect a bit too early after forwarding was done, causing Airmail
      to chirp away for minutes, tying up the frequency. This is a HUGE fix,
      the final 'FQ' from JNOS now gets sent to Airmail, and it now sees a
      proper FBB disconnect request, and shuts down PACTOR properly !

12) Some new designs in the HFDD code for more reliable data exchange with
    the HF modems. Some of it is just being used with the new PK232 hostmode
    driver, looks promising - will eventually make it to the other HF modems.

13) NOSaprs is now version 2.0g - fixed a bug where compressed data was not
    being properly validated and therefore getting trashed. NOSaprs can now
    gate OBJECTS to rf - new 'obj2fr' callsign list added. Finally, now using
    'callcheck()' instead of 'setcall()' to better determine whether an APRS
    recipient is an actual HAM callsign, or just another bulletin.

14) New Mailbox (MBX) logging - better consistency logging MBOX activities.

15) Notification (user customizable shell scripts) for when users connect or
    disconnect from the BBS, or for when users connect, message, or disconnect
    from the conference (CONV) bridge. Play a wave file on an event, or send
    email on an event, or both - or whatever one program into a script file.

16) Ditched the use of the GLIBC tmpnam() function - I'm tired of the link
    warning saying it is a dangerous function - too much structural change
    required to convert to mstemp(). I have created my own version based on
    the GLIBC one, but stripped down, and without the warning messages.

17) The 'update Domain.txt' logging is now 'switched off' by default :)

18) The psignal(), getdate(), gettime() functions have been prefaced with 'j2'
    prefix - done to avoid conflicts with any O/S calls having the same name.
    No more of these #define j_psignal or j_getdate, or #undef getdate, etc.

19) Compiler warnings have all been fixed (on my development systems), so
    this release should now compile with little to no warnings anymore.

20) Removed old and unused code from various source files.

21) Reinstated the original 'checkstack' code, use -DCHKSTK in makefile !

22) Cleaned up the 'config.h' file - created 2 distinct sections - one for
    features specific to JNOS 2.0, the other for features from JNOS 1.11f.


differences between JNOS 2.0f and 2.0f [Beta] - December 21, 2007
-----------------------------------------------------------------

1) Time to freeze things into an official version. I have not done alot
   of development lately anyways, and if I am to ever update the original
   jnos 1.11f documentation to where we are now, I need a frozen version.

2) Added callsign validation for BBS login. I have to thank Barry (K2MF)
   for the validation code. There is a new '#define MBX_CALLCHECK' in the
   config.h file - enabled by default. Now only *valid* callsigns will be
   accepted when you try to login to a JNOS server via telnet.

3) The way the email address is being formatted in the aprsmail () function
   has been changed. Apparently it is NOT legal to use the ( and ) characters
   in the local part of the email address. Thanks to Janusz for finding this.

4) I have fixed another HFDD bug, where incoming HF connects were not
   seeing a mailbox prompt in some cases. I have also shortened the text
   of the HFDD beacon - the "INTERNET GATEWAY" portion has been removed.

5) Bumped up the version of NOSaprs to match this latest version of JNOS :-)


differences between JNOS 2.0f [Beta] and 2.0e - Tuesday, June 12, 2007
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1) The JNOS (linux version) kernel has been revamped !

   There was little choice - JNOS 2.0e would not compile on Fedora Core 6, or
   Ubuntu, or any of the more recent linux distributions, unless you applied a
   patch that I came out with last year. The good thing about this is that it
   will still work on older distributions, like my Slackware 9.1 system.

   The developers of the GLIBC have *fixed* things so that one can no longer
   use the jmpbuf calls (setjmp/longjmp) as they have been traditionaly used
   by the JNOS kernel. The reasoning was that these calls should never have
   been allowed in the first place type of thing, etc, etc.

   As a result, I have revamped the JNOS kernel to instead use the ucontext
   calls (makecontext, swapcontext, setcontext, getcontext). Actually, this
   was very easy to do, since the original JNOS 1.11f had most of the code
   in place already - a prior developer was experimenting with Sun O/S.

2) Fixed a bug in the forwarding code - a typing mistake I made when I put in
   the 'telpac' option for JNOS 2.0e - FBB compressed forwarding was disabled
   for ANY and ALL forwards to other remote systems asking for it. There was a
   patch for it, but the patch never made it onto my website for some reason.

3) The 'ax25 status', 'ax25 kick', and 'ax25 reset' commands have been
   enhanced so that you can now pass the remote call instead of having to
   type in the &AXB (that 8 digit hex number). This is a feature I have
   long wanted to add. I always hated having to look up the &AXB, then
   mess it up (or somehow forget it) while entering it seconds later.

4) More improvements to the HFDD (HF Digital Device) code, including a new
   feature where the drivers will automatically detect whether a KAM or PTC
   is in host mode or not. If not, JNOS will try to put them into host mode,
   using a user configurable init file (new feature) for each HF modem. The
   code structure of both the KAM and PTC drivers were recently revamped.

   The only major thing left to do is revamp the DXP38 driver. I have not had
   alot of time to finish it - I felt it a priority to get a new release out
   first (that being JNOS 2.0f), due to the kernel issue, and it has been a
   while since a new version was releasted to the public.

   If a BBS user or SYSOP enters the 'mbox' command, it used to be that it was
   not very clear if an HFDD session was active or not. In most cases, all you
   would see was a bunch of gibberish where the HFDD session was supposed to
   be. I have fixed this,  so that any active sessions show up as 'Pactor'.

   Keyboard mode (ie, the ability for a BBS user or SYSOP to connect to a
   remote station via a HFDD port, then *chat*) has been removed for now. It
   never worked very well, and there were USER issues that came up which I
   had a hard time figuring out a solution for. Perhaps down the road ...

   HFDD devices are strictly for forwarding with a remote BBS now, or
   accepting calls FROM a remote station.

   NEW and up-to-date documentation for this latest HFDD implementation.

   As usual, work on the HFDD code is always ongoing, and experimental.

   From this point on, you won't hear much more about the HFDD development,
   as I am sure most of you are tired of hearing about it. That's all I had
   been doing off and on during the middle of the year, and frankly, there
   is not much left to do on it - It seems I am my only customer anyways.


differences between JNOS 2.0e and 2.0d1 - Tuesday, April 18, 2006
-----------------------------------------------------------------

1) The NRR (netrom route record) code has been separated from the INP3 code,
   and is now independent of the INP3 functionality. To include NRR support
   in JNOS 2.0e, use '#define NRR' in the config.h file before compiling.

   Here's an example of the NRR command at the BBS (mailbox) prompt :

     Area: ve4klm (#1) >
     nrr wa7v-2
     *** route: VE4KLM-1 K7EK-8 WA7V-2* K7EK-8 VE4KLM-1
     >

2) Added PARAM_PACTOR to device parameters. The command :

     param dxp38 17 1

   can now be issued as follows (if the sysop does not like using a number) :

     param dxp38 Pactor 1

3) Finally - a true HFDD device (actually just a plain serial device). Up until
   now, the DXP, SCS, and KAM modems had to be attached as an AX25 device, even
   though they were not using the AX25 protocol. To keep the communications to
   the modems from getting messed up, the sysop was required to disable the AX25
   and MBOX beacons - a kludge of sorts. This change should stabilize the HFDD
   serial interface quite a bit.

   Previous to JNOS 2.0e, a typical autoexec.nos entry for a DXP38 would be :

     attach asy ttyS1 - ax25 dxp38 4096 256 9600

     ifconfig dxp38 description "Pactor 1 - 10.129.1 or 7077.1 LSB"

     param dxp38 Pactor 1

     ax25 bcport dxp38 off

     mbox mport dxp38 off

  With JNOS 2.0e, the following is now the proper way to do it :

     attach asy ttyS1 - hfdd dxp38 4096 256 9600

     ifconfig dxp38 description "Pactor 1 - 10.129.1 or 7077.1 LSB"

     param dxp38 Pactor 1

4) NOSaprs is now at version 2.0b, the biggest change is that I have
   rewritten the APRS digi code to reflect the latest new-N paradigm,
   and callsign substitution for WIDE1-1 and RELAY. Janusz (SP1LOP)
   from Poland has confirmed that the code is working as it should.

   Further more, experimental SSn-N code exists, and is currently
   specific to Germany and Poland. Again, Janusz has confirmed this
   code is working as it should. One can change this to suit their
   own regions by modifying the 'aprsdigi.c' module. I will make
   this configurable (autoexec.nos) in some future release.

   Rewrote some of the code that does the NOSaprs 14501 webpage. One
   should note that the generated URL string is slightly different in
   this new version. For example the word, 'interface' is now 'ifc'.

   Bumped up the maximum stack size for APRS Server to be safe.

5) Removed timeout code that waits for an HFDD connection to get
   established. The code was never written very well, and generated
   some very undesireable effects if it kicked in at the wrong time.

   When reading the forward.bbs file to establish a connect, the HFDD
   code was improperly dealing with an EOL (end of line) read from the
   forward.bbs file. This was causing truncation of the remote callsign
   being used in the HFDD connect command. This is now fixed.

6) JNOS 2.0e can now do basic TELPAC forwarding with WL2K systems. A new
   option called 'telpac' has been added to the 'forward.bbs' file - ie:

     ---------------
     k4cjx
     tcp <name of k4cjx's server> <port> telpac
     @
     @
     @
     +Callsign :
     @
     ..VE4KLM
     +Password :
     @
     .<password>
     k4cjx
     ---------------

7) Added CL_HFDD to interface types, so that I can clearly identify HFDD
   interfaces. The HFDD interfaces will no longer show up as AX25 ports
   when a BBS user issues the PORTS command, but instead will be listed
   in their own category, for example :

     Area: ve4klm (#1) >
     Available AX.25 Ports:
     wsc    :  internet link - VE4WSC
     430    :  1200 Baud - 145.01 Mhz
     Available HFDD Ports:
     dxp38  :  Pactor 1 - 10.135.5 or 7077.1 LSB

   Remember - HFDD ports are hostmode TNC ports, nothing to do with AX25.

8) Solved a problem that has plagued JNOS (Linux) for a long time - user logs
   onto the BBS, then enters the NODES command at the mailbox prompt, only to
   see JNOS crash and restart.

   It seems the qsort() call is very stack intensive, and can easily push the
   maximum stack size when the NETROM Node table gets a bit too big. It turns
   out that the Linux qsort() is a recursive function, using ALOT of stack if
   it needs to. I did some searching and found an ANSI-C version of qsort that
   is easy on the stack, and NON-RECURSIVE. I literally pasted the code into
   a new JNOS function which I call j2qsort(), which JNOS now uses in place
   of the Linux qsort().

   Since I have done this, JNOS has yet to crash on me, whether I enter the
   NODES command at the BBS prompt, or NETROM ROUTES or NETROM ROUTE INFO at
   the F10 (console) screen. I can easily list 600+ node entries now.

9) The beginning of some big changes ...

   Most (if not all) NOS variants (and JNOS is no exception) use function calls
   that have the same name as their UNIX counterparts - 'bind', 'recvfrom', and
   'socket' are just a few examples, as is the NCURSES 'tputs' function.

   To avoid clashes with the system calls, NOS variants have traditionally used
   entries like the following to get around these :

     #define connect j_connect
     #define recvfrom j_recvfrom
     #define tputs j_tputs

   These are typically found in header files like socket.h and global.h.

   Starting with JNOS 2.0e, I am removing the above method. Instead, I will
   actually be renaming the JNOS functions to be clearly distinguishable from
   their UNIX (or WINDOWS) counterparts. For example, the tputs() function in
   JNOS would be renamed to j2tputs, and the '#define tputs j_tputs' removed.

   Why ? I want the flexibility to call UNIX socket functions for example,
   and not worry about conflicts with the JNOS ones. I may try to port JNOS
   to Windows at some point, and there again I may want to directly access the
   winsock libraries. I'm thinking the more self contained JNOS appears, the
   easier these tasks will be for me down the road (I think so anyways).

   I don't want people to get alarmed by all these changes. They're harmless,
   and if anything, will contribute to a more stable JNOS 2.0 down the road. 

10) Rewrote the locking code that I originally did for Netrom tables, then
    added scalability for other tables like tcb, timers, usocks. After some
    long term observation though, it has occurred to me that locks are for the
    most part, not a big concern, since the type of task scheduling used by
    NOS is such that operations on tables can only happen from one particular
    process at a time anyways. BUT, I'm sure there are cases that *might*
    require locks (when and if I ever find them), so the code stays ...


differences between JNOS 2.0d1 and 2.0d
---------------------------------------

* Mostly bug fixes and diagnostics, no command or syntax changes.

1) Fixed a situation where anyone who ran an APRS enabled JNOS binary, but
   didn't have APRS configured, would see JNOS crash on each incoming APRS
   frame.

2) Bumped up the NOSaprs version to 2.0a, in preparation for providing once
   again, the NOSaprs update kit for JNOS 1.11f and TNOS users.

3) Fixed a situation where compressed data formats for the !, =, /, and @ DTI
   values were not being recognized and passed by the validation routine.

4) If we get a directed APRS query that we don't support, we now send a message
   back to the user saying so. Previously, we did nothing.

5) Fixed a situation where if 'aprs contact' was not defined in autoexec.nos,
   and a 14501 page was requested, then JNOS would crash each time.

6) INP3 - more work done, spent alot of time reviewing the code against the
   linux version of INP3 by PE1RXQ. This code is not complete yet and should
   not be used at this time. I regret having made such a big thing out of it
   in the last release. Do NOT compile it into your binary (in other words,
   make sure you '#undef INP3' in your config.h before you mass compile).

   I'm not sure where the INP3 stuff will go at this stage. I simply have
   not had the time to work on it lately. It's on the shelf for now !

7) Some code cleanup here and there, the major one being replacement of all
   malloc() calls in JNOS with mallocw() instead. Did some cutting down of
   duplicate code in the kernel subroutines. Fixed a few bugs.

8) Fixed the pactor connect code for the SCS PTC units to use just a plain
   old 'C callsign'. There should be no port specifier. Previously I had used
   the syntax 'C 1:callsign' instead, which is simply wrong for the HF mode.

9) Added some experimental locking of the netrom route tables, plus a netrom
   'lock conflicts' counter in the netrom status command. This was put in more
   for me to investigate why the Nodes command crashes JNOS from time to time.


differences between JNOS 2.0d and JNOS 2.0c5a
---------------------------------------------

1) The DOS release is once again at the same level as the Linux release, and
   the makefile for the DOS release has been revamped (simplified). The Linux
   release will now compile properly up to GCC versions 3.4.3 and 4.0.1.

2) New subcommands added to the JNOS 'netrom' command :

     netrom debug [on|off]

     netrom nrr [callsign of a remote netrom node]

     netrom l3rtt [callsign of neighbour] [interface]

3) New command added to JNOS :

     start inp3

4) New command added to BBS user prompt :

     nrr [callsign of a remote netrom node]

   For example, here is a NRR request to on6dp from my system the other day :

     Area: ve4klm (#1) >
     nrr on6dp
     Area: ve4klm (#1) >
     *** route: VE4KLM VE4WSC WA7V-2 ON6DP* WA7V-2 VE4WSC VE4KLM
     >

5) New type of callsign list for APRS callsign filtering :

     aprs calls micetorf [list of calls or patterns]

6) Added a new directory for the APRS position database (a new project) :

     ${JNOSROOTDIR}/aprs/db/positions

7) Kantronics KAM Series Host Mode Driver (not completed yet)

   A crude prototype Host Mode driver for Kantronics KAM modems now exists,
   and a couple of milestones were set. I spent alot of time on this early
   in the summer, however it's not ready for general use at this time.
   
   a) working single channel KAM hostmode implementation for JNOS 2.0, for
      the packet (non-HF) mode. I had it working on an old KPC-2, as well as
      on a version 5.0 KAM that I borrowed from a friend.

   b) got it working with the AMTOR mode, using two backtoback KAM modems
      talking to each other (one JNOS, the other Mailbox mode). I was able
      to do some live testing as well, but nothing more has happened since.

      Testing has been limited to AMTOR, because that is all I can do at this
      time with the older KAM modems that I have here. Due to me having poor
      equipment, lack of live testers on RF, and lack of time in general, the
      KAM Host Mode driver is on the shelf for now. Adding the GTOR and PACTOR
      modes to it will be a piece of cake, but until I get my hands on a KAM XL
      or similar, this part of the project is on hold till further notice.

   c) Special thanks to Mitch Hill - K1FH - AFA1HN, for helping out, and for
      being a mentor of sorts with respect to AMTOR and QRG terminology :-)

8) INP3 Support (alot has been done, but not completed yet)

   JNOS 2.0d has partial support for INP3 stuff. Ideas and code fragments
   have been borrowed from the INP3 Kernel Patches by PE1RXQ, and work is
   ongoing. If you want INP3 support, then #define INP3 in config.h, then
   recompile the source. This is VERY experimental, and not complete yet.

   JNOS will recognize incoming RIF (Route Information Frames) from INP3
   netrom neighbours, and update quality/return time values in the nodes
   table (more needs to be done there). JNOS will respond to an L3RTT if
   a INP3 netrom neighbour sends it one.

   If you want JNOS to regularily send out it's own RIF and L3RTT to its
   neighbours, then you can run the INP3 scheduler using 'start inp3'.

   Again, this is experimental and incomplete, but I felt that I really
   needed to get another JNOS update out to the masses. To see the INP3
   stuff in action, turn on 'netrom debug' - see section 2) above. The
   debugging goes to the master logfile at ${JNOSROOT}/log/DDMMMYY.

   * It is possible that the INP3 code may add some stability to JNOS
     configurations that have links to INP3 netrom neighbours. Then again,
     it might just be my imagination, your results may vary, let me know.

9) NRR (Netrom Route Record)

   Even though NRR packets (Netrom Route Record) are not really part of the
   INP3 stuff, it is currently available only if you '#define INP3' in the
   config.h source file. I'll move it out at a later release.

   Sysop and BBS user can now ask for a NRR to a remote node - see section
   number 4) above. Also, if JNOS receives a NRR request from a neighbour, it
   will now format the proper reply so that the remote user sees a path.

A) Started work on a positional database, new module 'aprsposdb.c', and a new
   directory under the APRS root directory, ie (/jnos/aprs/db/positions). Any
   positions coming in from RF are to be added to the database. The idea is to
   have NOSaprs read the database at any time, and generate a graphical map of
   a region, with positions of stations overlayed on the map. Compiling this
   feature depends on the #define/#undef APRS_POSIT_DB option in config.h. It
   is currently undefined, the code sitting there for future development.

B) Enabled monitor mode for the DXP38 when running in P-Mode (Pactor), so
   I can observe more details (and Pactor traffic) when running HFDD server
   mode on my DXP38 (ie, 'hfdd server dxp38 start').

C) Added a feature (#define DEFAULT_SIGNATURE in config.h) that will add a
   system signature to ALL outgoing mail from JNOS. If defined, JNOS will add
   the contents of the '/jnos/spool/signatur/default.sig' file to the end of
   all outgoing messages composed by any BBS user. In hindsight, I really have
   to wonder why I bothered with this - perhaps to put disclaimer of sorts on
   outgoing messages, to protect the sysop from users bending the rules ?

D) Added a feature (#define MAIL_TRACE_USER_PORT in config.h) that will
   add something like the following to all outgoing mail from JNOS :

     X-JNOS-User_Port: <mbox status for particular user>

   allowing the recipient of a messages to see what 'signed in' user sent it,
   and on what JNOS port that user was connected, when message was composed.

E) Problem in the REMOTE client command, it was crashing alot, the 'udpadd'
   subcommand was not working properly. It turns out that I was not setting
   the key information correctly for 'udpadd'. Problem should be fixed now.

F) The APRS code is now able to gate MIC-E frames from the APRS IS (internet
   system) to RF. A new callsign list was added, to control what stations are
   allowed to have their MIC-E information sent out RF. See section 5) above,
   note compiling this feature depends on the #define/#undef GATE_MICE_RF
   directive in the config.h source file.

G) Fixed some minor bugs, fixed a whole bunch of missing initializers, and
   renamed the 'log' function to 'nos_log', to avoid conflicts with built-in
   system libraries. This had to be done, partly because the more recent GCC
   compilers were complaining about it. The 'log2' function was also dealt
   with for similar reasons. Cleaned up some old code here and there.

H) If you are using a JNOS binary that has NETROM compiled into it, and you
   fail to 'attach netrom' (in other words, you're not interested in running
   the netrom stuff), BUT you happen to have netrom neighbours that broadcast
   nodes and stuff to you, very likely your JNOS will crash each time a nodes
   broadcast comes in. The solution was either '#undef NETROM' in config.h,
   or run the 'attach netrom' command in your autoexec.nos config file.

   This is now fixed ! It was actually an existing problem before JNOS 1.11f


differences between JNOS 2.0c5a and JNOS 2.0c5
----------------------------------------------

1) Syntax change for 'ax25 xdigi' - added optional callsign substitution

     ax25 xdigi [source port] [dest port] [digi call] [substitute call]

   The 'subsitute call' is optional.

2) Proper changeover code for the SCS PTC modems added, so technically
   the forwards to any WL2K system should now work just as good as the
   Halcomm DXP modems.

3) The 14501 page has evolved to include conventional packet stations
   heard, current and past users connected or logged in. The layout has
   also changed a little bit. This is an ongoing project ...

   This requires a new 'jheard.o' in the makefile - see 'makefile.aprs',
   distributed in this update.

4) Added a new '#undef WELCOMEUSERS' for 'config.h', to cut down on the
   stuff displayed to users that have just logged in or connected to the
   system - see the file, 'config.h.dist', distributed in this update.

5) Put the '#define APRS_DIGI' back into the 'aprs.h' header file, as it
   was accidently undefined when I created the last official version.

6) Removed some excessive entries from the JNOS log files, the new ax25
   custom cross port digipeat rules had a bit too much logging enabled.


differences between JNOS 2.0c5 and 2.0c4
----------------------------------------

1) New command (see documents for details)

     ax25 xdigi [source port] [dest port] [digi call]

2) Changes in the directory and file structure for the NOSaprs component

     there is a new root directory for the NOSaprs, meaning you will have
     to create a new directory, move some files, and delete the old. Here's
     what you need to do (below). For illustration purposes I use '/jnos'
     as the JNOS root directory (which is what most people use anyways).

   a) create a new directory, '/jnos/aprs'

   b) move the directory '/jnos/msgdb' to '/jnos/aprs/msgdb'

   c) move the file '/jnos/spool/aprs/aprs.txt' to '/jnos/aprs/aprs.txt'

   d) delete the directory '/jnos/Spool/aprs'

   e) feel free to put the NOSaprs log file under the new root directory,
      so for example in your autoexec.nos configuration file :

        aprs log /jnos/spool/log/aprs.log

      could be changed to :

        aprs log /jnos/aprs/master.log
