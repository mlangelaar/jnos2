 1) Network Interfaces to Host Operating System
    -------------------------------------------

   JNOS has always had a way to setup a point-to-point network link between itself
   and the host operating system on which it runs, allowing it to network with the
   whatever networks the host operating system has access to.

   It can be as simple as just a linux box without a network connection. OR just
   a small LAN with terminals for basic telnet access to JNOS for multiple users
   and local servers for JNOS to interact with. OR ultimately, full blown routing
   to the internet and vice versa.

   Network connectivity between JNOS and the host operating system is trivial.

   The IP routing to other networks is the part which will challenge you :]

   There is no reason why you can't run multiple point-to-point links between
   your JNOS system and the host operating system, I've never done it, but if
   you think about it, it's technically possible - for what I don't know ...

 1.1) Enable IP Forwarding
      --------------------

   In order for network traffic to cross this point-to-point link between JNOS
   and its' host operating system, one has to enable IP forwarding on the host
   operating system, so for example, on older slackware releases I do this :

    echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

   In the case of systemd based linux, you might see people do this instead :

    sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

   and to make it permanent, they add the last part to /etc/sysctl.conf

 1.2) Original JNOS 1.11f (slip) Method
      ---------------------------------

   JNOS 1.11f uses a slip interface via pseudo tty devices.

   On the linux side you would run the 'slattach' linux program, which
   was usually started in the /etc/rc.d/rc.local or similar file :

     #
     # Initialize the SLIP interface for the JNOS router
     #
     /usr/sbin/slattach -s 38400 -p slip /dev/ptyp0 &
     #
     sleep 3
     #
     /sbin/ifconfig sl0 192.168.1.130
     /sbin/ifconfig sl0 netmask 255.255.255.224
     /sbin/ifconfig sl0 pointopoint 192.168.1.131
     /sbin/ifconfig sl0 mtu 1500
     /sbin/ifconfig sl0 up
     #

  And on the JNOS side you would use 'attach tty' command :

     #
     attach asy ttyp0 - slip sl0 4096 256 38400
     #
     ifconfig sl0 ipaddress 192.168.1.131
     ifconfig sl0 netmask 255.255.255.0
     ifconfig sl0 mtu 1500
     #

 1.3) JNOS 2.0 (tun) Method
      ---------------------

   JNOS 2.0 uses a tun interface, direct to a kernel device.

   There is no need to run anything on the linux side anymore, however if
   you decide (wisely) to run JNOS as a non-root user, see further below.

   Traditionally, you would do this as root user, since only a process run as
   root is able to create the necessary tun kernel device, so typical entries
   in your autoexec.nos file would be :

     #
     attach tun tun0 1500 0
     #
     ifconfig tun0 ipaddress 192.168.1.131
     ifconfig tun0 netmask 255.255.255.0
     ifconfig tun0 mtu 1500
     #
     # make sure tun interface is up
     #
     pause 1
     #
     # the way TUN works, it does not exist before JNOS starts, so we need
     # to shell out and configure the linux host side for this to work.
     #
     shell ifconfig tun0 192.168.1.130 pointopoint 192.168.1.131 mtu 1500 up
     #

 1.4) Do NOT run JNOS as root user
      ----------------------------

   Over the past few years there have been concerns about running any type of
   program as root user, especially if network interfaces are exposed.

   The solution is quite simple actually. Create the tun interface when linux
   first boots up or do it manually as the root user or via sudo command :

     ip tuntap add mode tun dev tun4

     ifconfig tun4 192.168.200.200 pointopoint 192.168.200.201 mtu 1500 up

   NOTE : be careful you don't specify an existing tun interface ! If you
          are running openVPN like I am, then tun0 is already being used,
          which is the reason I picked tun4, so please check first.

   Once the tun interface exists, then run JNOS as a non-root user :

     #
     attach tun tun0 1500 0 tun4
     #
     ifconfig tun0 ipaddress 192.168.200.201
     ifconfig tun0 netmask 255.255.255.0
     ifconfig tun0 mtu 1500

   NOTE : pay close attention to the attach command, notice the extra argument,
          and also note the JNOS interface (port) name is not related to it.

   The immediate 'benefit' of this method is you no longer need to shell out
   to configure the linux host side anymore, since it's already done for you.

   NOTE : the ability of JNOS 2.0 to actually work this way only came out the
          second week of January, 2018, thanks to KB8OJH (Ethan) for a patch.
            (https://kb8ojh.net/packet/jnos.html)

   Technically you 'could' run this configuration as root user ?

 2) AX.25 Wormholes
    ---------------

 An AX.25 wormhole is a point-to-point AX.25 tunnel between two systems, Think of this
 tunnel as an imaginary radio link between two systems. When internet got cheap, these
 tunnels started to replace direct radio links between systems. Some folks referred to
 this as the coming of the Land Line Lids, easier to link systems via internet then to
 have to spend money and resources on radio equipment, towers, antennas, insurance.

 JNOS 1.11f features AXIP wormholes, check original user manual for 'attach axip'.

 2.1) New AXUDP Wormhole
      ------------------

 JNOS 2.0 adds a new AXUDP wormhole, basically the same thing as AXIP, but transmission
 of AX.25 frames is done over UDP instead of IP. The intent of the UDP based wormholes
 was such that systems could operate through firewalls that naturally blocked anything
 non-TCP or non-UDP in nature, such as AXIP or even IPIP, both peer level protocols to
 TCP and UDP at the IP Protocol level, but protocols many firewall routers blocked.

 2.2) Command Syntax
      --------------

 The command syntax is as follows (at the JNOS console or in autoexec.nos file) :

   attach axudp <iface> <mtu> <ipaddress> [<callsign>] [<UDP src port>] [<UDP dest port>]

 the arguments are the same as for 'attach axip', except being this is UDP, you need the
 ability to specify UDP source and destination ports, which is optional. If they are not
 specified in the 'attach axudp' command, then both default to UDP port 93.

 IF you need to specify alternative UDP ports, but you don't want a callsign configured,
 then simply use the '-' character in the space for <callsign>. For example :

   attach axudp gus 256 i0ojj.mooo.com - 10093 10093

 You can also use -1 as the UDP src port, which will allow UDP from any source port, this
 feature was added in late 2013, and 'allowed' for cases where people had bizzare firewall
 routers, or used NAT with port mapping. I don't even remember anymore, but if you decide
 to do this, make sure you have control (firewall) of who is allowed to send you axudp.

 2.3) Wormholes with Dyn DNS style remote hosts (for AXIP as well)
      ------------------------------------------------------------

 JNOS 2.0 allows you to replace <ipaddress> with <hostname> instead, for both 'attach axip'
 and 'attach axudp' commands. This tells JNOS 2.0 to periodically resolve any hostnames to
 ensure a current IP address for the system at the other end of the wormhole.

 This is a powerful feature to maximize connectivity with remote systems having frequent
 changes to their IP address. Typically the remote side will arrange to setup some type
 of dyndns (dynamic DNS) hostname, which you would then use in your 'attach' command.

 2.4) Maximum AXIP and AXUDP Interfaces
      ---------------------------------

 JNOS 2.0 allows you to specify the maximum number of combined axip and axudp interfaces
 at runtime - no longer hardcoded, with a default value set to 16 (NAX25). It's combined
 because the axip and axudp interfaces share common code and command structures.

 The command syntax is as follows (from the linux command prompt) :

   jnos -a 24

 3) Message Forwarding and BBS operations

 3.1) Forwarding With Winlink
      -----------------------

 JNOS 2.0 is able to forward with Winlink CMS Servers, and as of JNOS 2.0m.2, you can
 actually download messages for multiple winlink accounts (calls), not just your own,
 with each call getting their messages delivered to their own JNOS bbs user area.

 At the same time, JNOS 2.0 bbs users can compose messages to Winlink accounts, with
 the delivery of messages done on the 'next forwarding' with the Winlink CMS server.

 Message forwarding is done using the B2F protocol over a telnet session.
  (just to be clear, this is NOT smtp, messages are not exchanged by email)

 Reference : Open B2F -- Winlink Message Structure and B2 Forwarding Protocol 
  (visit the URL 'https://winlink.org/B2F' for the complete specification)

 3.1.1) Configuring /jnos/spool/forward.bbs
        -----------------------------------

 Add the following section to your forward.bbs configuration file :

    -------
    wl2k
    telnet cms.winlink.org 8772 cronly
    +Callsign :
    *10
    .URCALL
    +Password :
    @10
    .CMSTelnet
    wl2k
    -------

 Make sure to replace URCALL with your own Winlink Account callsign.
  (so for my system the entry would be .VE4KLM, note there is NO ssid)

 3.1.2) Configuring JNOS winlink callsign or callsigns
        ----------------------------------------------

 Use the 'mbox winlinkcalls' command to configure your own Winlink call, as well
 as any other Winlink calls for which you want JNOS to download messages for.

 The command syntax is as follows (at the JNOS console or in autoexec.nos file) :

   mbox winlinkcalls [primary] [secondary 1] [secondary 2] ... [secondary N]
     
 The primary call is mandatory, that's your own Winlink account.

 The secondary calls are optional of course. You would only specify them if you
 want to be able to download messages for those winlink accounts.

 3.1.3) Creating JNOS winlink account or accounts
        -----------------------------------------

 You must create a JNOS 2.0 winlink user account for each call configured.

 The command syntax is as follows (from the linux command prompt) :

   jnospwmgr -a [callsign] -w

 You will be asked to enter a password, for the specified Winlink Account callsign.

 3.1.4) Initiate Forwarding With Winlink
        --------------------------------

 Simply run the following command at the JNOS console :

   mbox kick Wl2k

 Note the 'capitalized' W which tells JNOS 2.0 to connect regardless of whether
 there is anything to send to Winlnk or not. Had I just specified 'wl2k', all in
 lowercase, nothing will happen, unless there are messages that were composed to
 Winlink users that are waiting to be delivered.

 This is how JNOS forwarding behaves, now you know.

 After issuing a kick, one should see activity in the JNOS log, for example :

   04:12:02  CONSOLE - mbox ki Wl2k
   04:12:02  52.1.178.80:8772 (2703) - MBOX (wl2k) connected
   04:12:03  - hostname [winlink-lb-628697408.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com]
   04:12:03  52.1.178.80:8772 (2703) - [VE4KLM] requesting secure login [66885467] PQchallenge

   04:12:03  52.1.178.80:8772 (2703) - [26249855] challenge response
   04:12:03  52.1.178.80:8772 (2703) - additional [ VE4PKT|26249855]
   04:12:03  52.1.178.80:8772 (2703) - MBOX (wl2k) forwarding
   04:12:03  52.1.178.80:8772 (2703) - MBOX (wl2k) proposal FC EM 63258_VE4KLM 214 193 0
   04:12:03  52.1.178.80:8772 (2703) - MBOX (wl2k) got response FS Y
   04:12:03  52.1.178.80:8772 (2703) - MBOX (wl2k) lzhuf compress 187/214 = 12 percent
   04:12:04  52.1.178.80:8772 (2703) - MBOX (wl2k) $63258_VE4KLM sent
   04:12:04  - only if we get FF send FQ
   04:12:04  52.1.178.80:8772 (2703) - MBOX (wl2k) fwd exit

 In the above example, I have my main Winlink callsign and VE4PKT as a secondary call for
 which I want to download messages for. As well, you can see I am forwarding a message to
 the VE4PKT Winlink account in this particular forwarding session.

 In another example, I first emailed test messages to both VE4KLM and VE4PKT at Winlink,
 using regular internet email from my personal email account :

      From : maiko@pcsinternet.ca
        To : ve4klm@winlink.org, ve4pkt@winlink.org,
   Subject : //WL2K another test on 22June2020 (monday)

 then after issuing a kick, my JNOS 2.0 log showed the following activity and you can see
 the messages coming in over the forwarding session, then being delivered to user areas :

   18:10:02  CONSOLE - mbox ki Wl2k

 3.1.5) Receiving Attachments from Winlink Users
        ----------------------------------------

 Believe it or not, JNOS will save attachements contained in any messages received when
 forwarding with Winlink. The B2F protocol allows for that. So you can have folks from
 the internet side send attachments to Winlink users, and those attachments can then be
 recovered right to your JNOS 2.0 system.

 It was something quickly developed quite some time ago, probably could be made a lot
 more user friendly. For instance, you don't have a choice where the files get saved,
 but if you're the sysop, that doesn't really matter. But still, needs to be better.

 BUT ... the feature appears 'broken' recently, not sure why, looking into it :(

 3.1.6) Composing Messages to Winlink Users
        -----------------------------------

 From the JNOS BBS prompt, one simply uses the usual SP command, for example :

   Area: ve4klm (#1) >
   sp ve4pkt@wl2k
   To: wl2k
   Subject:
   //WL2K test messages
   Enter message.  End with /EX or ^Z in first column (^A aborts):
   testing testing
   calling all cars 
   Maiko
   /ex

 BUT there are two things here you need to pay attention to :

  the '@wl2k' is very important. That tells JNOS 2.0 to put the
  message for that particular callsign into the wl2k forwarding
  area we setup earlier in the /jnos/spool/forward.bbs file.

  when composing messages to Winlink, your Subject must start
  with the phrase '//WL2K' although I am not a hundred percent
  sure that is mandatory within the context of B2F transfer.
   (it is a requirement with any internet email)

 This message and any other composed messages are held in the wl2k
 forwarding area until such time JNOS 2.0 is given the 'mbox kick'
 command, at which point they will be sent to the Winlink system.

 3.1.7) Automated (Scheduled) Forwarding
        --------------------------------

 You can tell JNOS 2.0 to automatically run the 'mbox ki Wl2k' at regular
 intervals use the 'AT' command at the JNOS console, or in the autoexec.nos
 file, for example :

   at 30 "mbox ki Wl2k+"

 which tells JNOS 2.0 to do this at the 1/2 hour mark for each hour.

 Search the original user manual for 'at time' for syntax and options.

 3.2) Proper Configuration of forward.bbs file
      ----------------------------------------

 Very recently, I spent some time trying to figure out how all of the commands
 in forward.bbs actually work and what they do. Monitoring the actual exchange
 of data in realtime using either the JNOS 'trace' command or 'tcpdump' on the
 linux side can be very helpful in refining your connect sequence in the file.

 The configuration presented further below actually waits for prompts to appear
 before sending anything, and I believe it is the way you should do forwarding
 on your JNOS 2.0 system. Before this, I would see configurations where if you
 were to look at a trace of the actual traffic between systems, you would see
 the login and password sent before any prompts even showed up, worse, they'd
 be sent in a single packet. They were basically brute forcing their way in.

 So below is a heavily documented version of the forward.bbs section outlined
 in Section 12.2.1, how to telnet forward TO an MFA enabled JNOS 2.0 system.

 This would apply to ax25 or netrom connections as well of course.

     #
     # Make sure to separate forward.bbs entries with '----'
     #
     -------
     #
     # ve4klm is the remote system that I want to forward with.
     #
     ve4klm
     #
     # I can manually initiate a forward from the JNOS console :
     #
     #   jnos > mbox ki Ve4klm
     #
     # Or I can use the JNOS 'at' command to schedule this :
     #
     #   at 30 "mbox ki Ve4klm+"
     #
     # In both cases above, note the first letter of the remote callsign is
     # in capitals, which simply means we will connect to the remote system
     # even if we have no messages to send, and initiate a reverse forward,
     # in the event they have something for us instead.
     #
     # You can leave the first letter of the call as lowercase of course, but
     # if you have nothing to send, and are waiting for something to come in,
     # you will never see it, unless the remote systems initiates a forward.
     #
     # I am using telnet to get to this particular remote system
     #
     telnet 192.168.200.201
     #
     # Set the prompt to wait for, don't send anything yet.
     #
     +login:
     #
     # Now we need to use '*' operator, since there are several lines
     # that show up before the login prompt does, each of those lines
     # will have a carriage return, so using '*' reads them all in.
     #
     # When we get to the login prompt, there is NO carriage return,
     # so we now have to depend on the timeout feature to get to the
     # next step in this file. From a technical point of view, JNOS
     # uses mbxrecvline() to read in data, so if it isn't terminated
     # with a carriage return it sits there till a timeout occurs.
     #
     # Many of these prompts are not followed by a carriage return,
     # so we have no choice but to depend on the timeout feature of
     # the forward.bbs command set to get to the next step.
     #
     # Wait for 1 second, you can bump it up for slow networks.
     #
     *1
     #
     # At this point, the login prompt has appeared, send my callsign.
     #  (note anything sent has to start with a period '.')
     #
     .ve4klm
     #
     # Again we set a prompt to wait for, don't send anything yet. This
     # time we are looking for the password prompt, same as above.
     #
     +Password:
     #
     # In this case we need to use the '@' operator, there's only 1 line.
     #
     # Wait for 1 second, you can bump it up for slow networks.
     #
     @1
     #
     # At this point, the password prompt has appeared, send your password.
     #  (again, note anything sent has to start with a period '.')
     #
     .MYPASSWORD
     #
     # Again we set a prompt to wait for, don't send anything yet. This
     # time we're looking for the 'multi factor authentication' prompt.
     #
     +Auth:
     #
     # Again we need to use '*' operator, since there is a carriage
     # return that needs to be read in before we get to the prompt.
     #
     # Wait for 1 second, you can bump it up for slow networks.
     #
     *1
     #
     # At this point, the Auth prompt has appeared, send your code.
     #  (again, note anything sent has to start with a period '.')
     #
     .A32D#2F
     #
     # At this point, the script is basically done, JNOS starts the
     # actual forwarding process for only those areas defined below.
     #
     mb
     ww
     #
     # Make sure to separate forward.bbs entries with '----'
     #
     -------

 3.2.1) Monitoring forward.bbs connection sequence
        ------------------------------------------

 You can have JNOS print out debugging information to the main console, as well
 as provide additional logging to the main JNOS log file, by turning on mailbox
 trace feature. Use the following command at the console :

     mbox trace on

 When you are done, switch it off using this command below :

     mbox trace off

 Of course, you could always enable a trace on the interface in use for your
 forwarding session. In the case of telnet forwarding, you'll likely need to
 run the trace on your tun0 or encap interface.

 Check section 15 for the JNOS 'trace' command. There was an enhancement made
 to the original command, so you will notice an extra 'sync' parameter.

 Or you can do it on the linux side as well, using tools like 'tcpdump'.

 In any event, now you have a few hopefully useful tools to help you nail down
 the proper sequence of commands in your forward.bbs file.

 3.2.2) Non Forwarding command scripts to remote systems
        ------------------------------------------------

 JNOS has the ability to run a script of commands on a remote bbs system, and
 log the results to file. This feature uses the forward.bbs mechanism - so any
 section defined in 'spool/forward.bbs' which ends with '_script' is treated as
 a remote command and log sequence (there is NO forwarding done for these).

 As an example, I would like to collect NETROM routing information from two of
 my forwarding partners, one runs JNOS, the other BPQ. A BBS user in JNOS will
 use the 'NR' command, but in BPQ they would use the 'RO' command instead.

 So I have the following 2 script entries defined in my forward.bbs file :

     -------
     n2nov_script
     ax25 newyork n2nov-4
     .nr
     +>
     *5
     -------
     k5dat_script
     net k5dat-7
     .ro
     +>
     *10
     -------

   This is just like any forwarding sequence, where I can just do a :

     mbox ki N2nov_script

   and/or

     mbox ki K5dat_script

   Note the capitalized first letter of section, since there will never be
   any mail to deliver with these scripts, or you could always add a poll
   option to the section line and not worry about the capitalization.

   Also note the lack of any message areas in the script definitions, it's
   all pure commands, and waiting for results. Hopefully people find it to
   be somewhat useful, we can certaintly build on it, feedback is welcome.

   The output file generated for eaction section is 'section'.dat, ie :

     n2nov_script.dat, k5data_script.dat

 3.3) Message BIDs now BASE36
      -----------------------

 As of 2.0m.5B - the BID for messages from 'our host' is now in BASE36 format.

 This gives us a much bigger range of several million numbers, instead of the
 original range of only 100 thousand BASE10 numbers, and then over again.

 If you use an email client (like thunderbird) to send messages to your JNOS
 system, you'll notice this version no longer uses a portion of the message-id
 present in the email header to generate the BID, rather it will just create
 another BASE36 BID from JNOS sequence number pool.

 I figure it is perfectly fine to do this now, since BASE36 extends the range
 of the BID to several million. The original message-id is still preserved in
 the message header anyways, so nothing is lost here.

 3.4) Control of Duplicate Messages
      -----------------------------

 As of 2.0m.5B - there is advanced DUPE protection for concurrent forwarding
 sessions with multiple remote hosts, where messages having the same BID are
 coming in from multiple sources at the same time, or even within seconds or
 minutes of each other.

 It should be noted that JNOS has always been vunerable to this, resulting in
 posting of duplicate messages, which in turn get forwarded to other systems,
 which is just not good.

 The solution up till now has been to stagger forwards with remote partners,
 such that only one partner is forwarding at any particular time. With this
 new feature, we can loosen things up considerably, and not worry about it.

 The 'excess' messages are deferred (not refused). We have to defer incase
 something breaks during processing of the 'accepted' message at the time.

 3.5) Security of Forwarding Partners
      -------------------------------

 As of 2.0m.5C - stations you have arranged to have incoming forwarding with,
 will need to have BBS permissions set for the respective users configured in
 your ftpusers file.

 This should protect against rogue or ignorant incoming connects from stations
 who could then proceed to send a SID, possibly followed by illegal 3rd party
 forwarding or forwarding of malicious messages.

 For BBS permissions OR 0x02000 - so 0x0407f in ftpusers becomes 0x0607f

 Up till now, this has always been allowed, but now JNOS will send a terse
 message to the 'offending' station first, instead of the SID, disrupting the
 message flow - it might require some refinement, let me know please.

 These events are also logged to the JNOS logfile as :

    "SID from non BBS user, discouraged"

 3.6) Rewrite File - can now target specific FROM users (stations)
      ------------------------------------------------------------

 Entries in the rewrite file are now capable of targeting (such a bad word)
 specific users / stations. In other words one can now add entries that apply
 to only a FROM <pattern>, for example :

       *@ww:ve4klm  hold
       *@ww ww

 This allows ALL incoming @ww to the ww area, but any @ww coming from me is
 actually sent to the hold area instead. Or you could just refuse any @ww
 coming from me, for example :

       *@ww:ve4klm  refuse
       *@ww ww

 In the case of refuse, it is rejected right when the proposal appears.

 What is new is the addition of the ':' tag, followed by a PATTERN to match in
 the FROM field of the incoming message (no spaces). Yes, it is a pattern, not
 a direct callsign match, sort of a wildcard ...

 3.7) Lack of Support for Partial (Restart Data) Forwarding
      -----------------------------------------------------

 JNOS still does not support the '!' or 'A' FSR character in any FS string it
 might receive from a remote BBS during a forward session. I have tried to get
 it working over the years, but my attempts to do so have been half hazardly
 tried, and in the end it remains a thorn in my side. I need to fix it, yes.

 It has been observed you can significaly reduce the chances of 'Restart Data'
 condition happening with BPQ or a 'continue forwarding partial file' in the
 FBB software, by adjusting the FBB max message blocksize on the remote end.

 I've thought of adding an FBB max message blocksize parameter to forward.bbs
 entries as one way to to deal with reducing the chances of this happening.

 3.8) Handling B2F from non-Winlink systems
      -------------------------------------

 It has been observed that some recent BPQ systems are presenting B2F in the
 SID, which can cause problems, since I wrote the B2F code mostly for Winlink
 CMS interactions.

 What I have done in the meantime is modified the code to downgrade any B2F
 connections from non-Winlink systems to use B1F instead, until such time I
 am able to get it properly working and properly tested.

 3.9) Special EOL handling, specific to linfbb forwarding issue
      ---------------------------------------------------------

 Some time in 2016, we ran into a bizarre forwarding issue, where inconsistent
 end of line (EOL) sequences were encountered while forwarding with linfbb.

 JNOS would expect 0x0d 0x0a, but at some point linfbb would start sending just
 the 0x0d (no 0x0a at all). If one had 'mbox tdisc' configured, JNOS would hang
 for that time, waiting for the 0x0a it would never receive, and then it would
 instead get a first byte of data from the next proposal or an FBB command. It
 effective broke the forward session. If you didn't configure 'mbox tdisc' at
 all, JNOS would likely hang 'forever' depending where it was in the forward
 session. I had talked with Bernard about it, and he was aware of the issue.

 So in the meantime, it was dealt with on the JNOS side, quite technical :|
  (you can read about it in the code and in the release history)

 Anytime this situation arose, JNOS would write EOL warnings to the JNOS log.

 You can suppress the EOL warnings using this JNOS console command :

     mbox eolwarnings off

 By default, they are enabled - at some point they'll annoy you (maybe).

 3.10) Telnet compressed forwarding issues, IAC character, past decade plus
       --------------------------------------------------------------------

 In simple terms, for any telnet session, there is one particular character
 value you have to watch out for. The value 255 (0xff) is also known as the
 IAC (interpret as command) byte. It's an escape character which allows for
 the embedding of telnet commands into the session itself. This is detailed
 in RFC 854 (telnet protocol specification), see the webpage link below :

    https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc854

 JNOS has 'support' for IAC in parts of the code, but not in the code that
 does the actual FBB compression (the yapp functions). So what happens is
 that if you have a telnet session with a system that is using IAC as per
 the RFC in the compression routines, JNOS does not care. It does not see
 the IAC as an escape character, it just sees it (and command bytes that
 follow) as just plain old data. The end result is that things 'break'.

 For years, I thought trying to intrepret IAC in these functions would most
 certainly corrupt any compressed data, honestly thinking it was transparent,
 with no imbedded byte sequences and such - well, live and learn eh ?

 It was determined that LINFBB and OBCM both interpret the IAC byte as per the
 RFC for the compressed part, where as JNOS, BPQ, and Winlink (CMS) did not !

 JNOS versions 2.0k and above now incorporate a new software flag, deep inside
 the socket layer code to flag whether JNOS should process the IAC byte or just
 treat it as data. The default behavior has always been to treat it as data. I
 wanted to preserve this to ensure backwards compabitity with all of the older
 versions of JNOS. You can read more about this in the release history.

 3.10.1) START TELNET - syntax change, new options
         -----------------------------------------

 As of version 2.0k, note the following syntax changes :

    autoexec.nos or JNOS console :

       start telnet [port] [options]

    forward.bbs file :

       telnet host [port] [options]

 In both of the above case, possible options are (single or combined) :

    cronly        telnet listener expects just 0x0d for EOL
    iac           enforce IAC during FBB compression
    noiac         treat IAC as regular data during FBB compression
  
 where the 'noiac' option is there for those who choose NOT to preserve the
 original behavior of JNOS regarding IAC when they compile their code.

 IF you are passing options, then you MUST specify a port, so even for the
 default telnet port 23, you will have to specify the 23.

 You can run multiple 'start telnet' commands, different ports and options

 I have put together the following file with forwarding config examples :

   http://www.langelaar.net/jnos2/documents/examples_2.0k.txt

 Thanks to Bob (VE3TOK) and Gus (I0OJJ) for providing much of this !

 4) SNMP Server (needs updating)
    -----------

 The only reason I added an SNMP service to JNOS was because I wanted to use
 the MRTG (and later, RRD) tools to monitor traffic on my JNOS interfaces.

 The first version of the server was (still is) quite limited, but serves my
 graphing needs for now.

 One can surely add to it if they want other types of information.

 The JNOS 2.0 SNMP server will only respond to SNMPv1, GetRequest PDU types.

 4.1) IF-MIB listing
      --------------

 Initial version only supported the following MIB entries (Interface Indexes) :

   ifInOctets       1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.10   .N
   ifOutOctets      1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.16   .N
   sysUpTime        1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3
   sysName          1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5

   NOTE : these are packet counts - NOT byte counts :|

 Subsequent versions allowed me to specify Interface Names in my MRTG configs,
 since I got tired of having to constantly edit MRTG configuration files each
 time I changed my JNOS port configuration. No matter how 'carefull' I was in
 making change, it always resulted in remapping of Interface Index values :

   ifName           6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.1     .N
   ifName.Counter   6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.2.1
   ifDesc           6.1.2.1.2.2.1.2        .N
   ifDesc.Counter   6.1.2.1.2.2.1.1.3.1
   ifType.Counter   6.1.2.1.2.2.1.1.4.1

 Anything else is ignored (for now).

 4.2) Configuration and Security
      --------------------------

 Security is through use of community name and ip address pattern combinations
 kept in an Access Control List (ACL). You can have as many entries as desired.

 The command syntax is as follows - at JNOS console or in autoexec.nos file :

   snmp ro [community name] [ip address pattern]

 The [ip address pattern] is optional, which opens it up to anywhere !

 To list the current ACL, simply run following command at the JNOS console :

   snmp ro

 You should probably setup a firewall strategy in general to protect your SNMP
 service.

 For example, suppose I want to allow SNMP access from only my private LAN at
 home, with all SNMP clients required to use the community name 'K0czhZ0cm',
 the command would be :

   snmp ro K0czhZ0cm 192.168.200

 I could just say that I want all of the ampr.org to access my SNMP server :

   snmp ro amprnet 44

 Oh yes - a postnote : I guess we don't 'own' the entire 44 anymore ...

 4.3) Finding Interface Index for specific JNOS interface
      ---------------------------------------------------

 Simply run the following command at the JNOS console :

   snmp ifaces

 which lists the 'index to port' mappings, for example :

  jnos> snmp ifaces
  iface #  name
         0 paul
         1 home
         2 ve7
         3 uro
         4 netrom
         5 lav
         6 bob
         7 gus
         8 hull
         9 que
        10 cal
        11 tun0
        12 loopback
        13 encap

 4.4) Batch Query with SNMP Client
      ----------------------------

   You can walk the JNOS 2.0 SNMP server, using linux command line :

     root@slackware:~# snmpwalk -v1 -c K0czhZ0cm 192.168.200.201 ifName

     IF-MIB::ifName.1 = STRING: paul
     IF-MIB::ifName.2 = STRING: home
     IF-MIB::ifName.3 = STRING: ve7
     IF-MIB::ifName.4 = STRING: uro
     IF-MIB::ifName.5 = STRING: netrom
     IF-MIB::ifName.6 = STRING: lav
     IF-MIB::ifName.7 = STRING: bob
     IF-MIB::ifName.8 = STRING: gus
     IF-MIB::ifName.9 = STRING: hull
     IF-MIB::ifName.10 = STRING: que
     IF-MIB::ifName.11 = STRING: cal
     IF-MIB::ifName.12 = STRING: tun0
     IF-MIB::ifName.13 = STRING: loopback
     IF-MIB::ifName.14 = STRING: encap

   BUT, you can actually specify a specific port as well :

     root@slackware:~# snmpwalk -v1 -c K0czhZ0cm 192.168.200.201 ifName.7
     IF-MIB::ifName.7 = STRING: bob

   You can replace 'ifName' in the above examples with 'ifInOctets', 'ifOutOctets', and 'ifDesc'.

   Passing the numeric representation of a particular MIB works as well :

     snmpwalk -v1 -c K0czhZ0cm 192.168.200.201 1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.16

     IF-MIB::ifOutOctets.1 = Counter32: 215249
     IF-MIB::ifOutOctets.2 = Counter32: 0
     IF-MIB::ifOutOctets.3 = Counter32: 15571
     IF-MIB::ifOutOctets.4 = Counter32: 59918
     IF-MIB::ifOutOctets.5 = Counter32: 350624
     IF-MIB::ifOutOctets.6 = Counter32: 96515
     IF-MIB::ifOutOctets.7 = Counter32: 2761769
     IF-MIB::ifOutOctets.8 = Counter32: 18538
     IF-MIB::ifOutOctets.9 = Counter32: 15571
     IF-MIB::ifOutOctets.10 = Counter32: 138206
     IF-MIB::ifOutOctets.11 = Counter32: 194751
     IF-MIB::ifOutOctets.12 = Counter32: 47893455
     IF-MIB::ifOutOctets.13 = Counter32: 0
     IF-MIB::ifOutOctets.14 = Counter32: 11928766

   NOTE : there is a trailing error using numeric, still trying to figure it out, sorry :(

     IF-MIB::ifMtu.1 = INTEGER: 16436
     Error: OID not increasing: IF-MIB::ifOutOctets.14
      >= IF-MIB::ifMtu.1

 4.5) Selective Query with SNMP Client
      --------------------------------

   You can pick off a specific item from the JNOS 2.0 SNMP server, using linux command line :

     root@slackware:~# snmpget -v1 -c K0czhZ0cm 192.168.200.201 1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.16.11
     IF-MIB::ifOutOctets.11 = Counter32: 192009
 
     This grabs the outgoing count for interface index 11, which is my JNOS tun0 interface.

   You can pass the string representation of a particular MIB as well, for example :

     root@slackware:~# snmpget -v1 -c K0czhZ0cm 192.168.200.201 ifInOctets.13
     IF-MIB::ifInOctets.13 = Counter32: 6161142

     This grabs the incoming count for interface index 13, which is my JNOS encap interface.

 5) Software Modems
    ---------------

   Using a soundcard or modulator board (baycom) in place of a full blown hardware based
   modem or TNC, has been around for many years now. There are some really good programs
   and systems out there, allowing you to explore tons of different digital modes.

   For AX.25 (packet) modes, JNOS 2.0 can interface with the following systems :

    Soundmodem
    Baycom Board
    Multipsk
    AGWPE
    Direwolf (using AGWPE emulation)

   There is a WINMOR interface as well (very experimental) - not for AX.25 though.

 5.1) Soundmodem by Thomas Sailer
      ---------------------------

   At the end of Jun, 2005, I posted a note to the TAPR xNOS Mailing List, after
   having discovered the very interesting 'soundmodem' by Thomas Sailer, which I
   decided to try out as an experiment. It took me less then 5 minutes to get it
   working and I was instantly impressed.

 5.1.1) The 2005 Experiment
        -------------------

   The original website I got the driver from was this one :

     http://www.baycom.org/~tom/ham/soundmodem

   POST NOTE : it is now 'blank' :(

   Back then I installed it on my Fedora 3 box at work using :

     rpm -ivh soundmodem-0.9-1.i386.rpm

   and configured it (basic afsk modulator, KISS packet i/o mode) :

     soundmodemconfig

   and lastly, started the soundmodem drive :

     service soundmodem start

   then in my autoexec.nos, add something like the following :

     attach asy soundmodem0 - ax25 vhf 4096 256 1200
     ifconfig vhf description "sndcard"

   Then ran JNOS, and tried a connect from the JNOS console :

     c vhf ve4rag

   and it worked, instant packet out the soundcard !

   NOTE : I had to build a PTT interface (no big deal), and there
          was some experimenting with configuration and settings.

 5.1.2) Still Works in 2012
        -------------------

   At the end of February, 2012, I was playing with soundmodem version 0.16,
   and noted there were some differences from versions before that.

   For example, you now needed a new '/etc/ax25' directory, containing an XML
   configuration file ''etc/ax25/soundmodem.conf'. Because I used slackware,
   I would just run the program as 'soundmodem &', instead of the service.

   The soundmodem.conf file is generated by 'soundmodemconfig', but if you
   were like me back then, and didn't have graphic libraries installed, it
   meant you couldn't run the configuration utility, so here's the file :

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<modem>
  <configuration name="tmp">
    <channel name="Channel 0">
      <mod mode="afsk" bps="1200" f0="1200" f1="2200" diffenc="1"/>
      <demod mode="afsk" bps="1200" f0="1200" f1="2200" diffdec="1"/>
      <pkt mode="KISS" ifname="sm0" hwaddr="" ip="10.0.0.1" netmask="255.255.255.0" broadcast="10.0.0.255" file="/dev/soundmodem0" unlink="1"/>
    </channel>
    <chaccess txdelay="150" slottime="100" ppersist="40" fulldup="0" txtail="10"/>
    <audio type="soundcard" device="/dev/dsp" halfdup="0"/>
    <ptt file="none"/>
  </configuration>
</modem>

   I'm sure you will have to tweak the values for your own system needs.

 5.1.3) Still Works in 2015
        ------------------

   In April of 2015, my JNOS was moved to Scientific Linux 7.1 - running on an
   older Dell Optiplex 330, reluctantly ditching all my TNCs because they were
   aging and unreliable. For some time after, I ran a single soundmodem port,
   with a homebrew interface direct to a reconditioned Icom IC28H, and it was
   rock solid (for me anyways).

 5.1.4) The Latest
        ----------

   I have not tried this since 2015, however, I am sure this will still work, if
   you consider the fact Scientific Linux 7 and similar are still in use today.

 5.2) Baycom Board
      ------------

   Sometime at the start of the 21rst century, I received an XR based Baycom
   Board from ZL1AVY (Doug Tennent) in my mailbox - just the board. I do not
   remember if it came with parts, I think I had to source them myself.

   I have to acknowledge Doug for this, since it opened up many possibilities
   for me, including extensive use as my main packet radio port in my original
   DOS based Flexnet and Baybox configurations. This board never disappointed,
   and worked very well for my needs. In fact, I still have the same board in
   my radio room - sitting on a shelf, waiting for the droves of packet radio
   users to return to the air waves :]

   In December of 2008, I wrote a 'direct to kernel module' interface for the
   classic BAYCOM Board, eliminating the need to have an in-between 'net2kiss'
   program and pseudo-tty device. All I did was use the kernel side code from
   the 'net2kiss' source and put it directly into the JNOS source.

   NOTE : that code is Copyright (C) 1996 by Thomas Sailer - he wrote it !

   Before this, JNOS would have to 'attach asy' to the pseudo-tty device used
   with the 'net2kiss' program, but with the new interface code it's now just
   a simple matter of using 'attach baycom' instead.

   NOTE : in fact you could use the new interface code for ANY situation where
          you wanted to replace the use of 'net2kiss' - not just for baycom.

   This would have been done on my slackware 9.1 system, 2.4.22 kernel, which
   came with the baycom_ser_fdx module already. Of course you will need kernel
   headers and development. If you are wanting to try this on another system,
   results may vary. If you feel like you need a challenge, then go for it.

   I was using the 'baycom_ser_fdx' module (device name bcsf0) at the time.

 5.2.1) My Poor TEKK Radio - Dangers of a Baycom Driver
        -----------------------------------------------

   Around the end of March, early April of 2011, I smoked an expensive 70cm Tekk Radio :]

     "Accidental comm port conflict, darn it all, took me 10 minutes to notice
      my baycom driver was sitting on the PTT to my Tekk radio, and suspect the
      damage has been done, it's not working anymore"

   You may seriously want to consider some type of PTT watchdog circuitry to
   protect your radio, heatsinking on these things was not the greatest, and
   this resulted in a good discussion on the NOS-BBS list back then.

   I wound up building a 555 timer based circuit to protect the replacement radio.

 5.2.2) Linux Side Configuration
        ------------------------

   Load the kernel modules first (as root) - for my system (ttys0) :

       modprobe ax25

       modprobe hdlcdrv

       insmod baycom_ser_fdx mode="ser12*" iobase=0x3f8 irq=4

      you can determine this by 'cat /proc/tty/driver/serial'

   You MUST ensure the kernel interface is *up*, using :

       ifconfig bcsf0 up

   Only then will the 'attach baycom' command work on the JNOS side. If you fail
   to do this, then the JNOS 'baycom_rx' process will terminate everytime you try
   and do an attach, and nothing will work.

 5.2.3) JNOS 2.0 Configuration
        ----------------------

  The command syntax is as follows (at the JNOS console or in autoexec.nos file) :

     attach baycom vhf 300 bcsf0
     pause 2
     ifconfig vhf description "1200 baud on 145.01 Mhz"
     param vhf 2 256
     param vhf 3 1
     param vhf 5 1
     param vhf TxDelay 20

  JNOS 2.0 has BAYCOM support enabled by default, but you can check your own
  config.h for the necessary '#define BAYCOM_SER_FDX' entry. If it's missing
  or has been '#undef', then just correct it, and do the following :

     rm baycom.o config.o version.o
     make

  * you should not have to do a make clean, it's just a few files.

  This worked very well (repeating myself) - not disappointed at all !

 5.2.4) The Latest
        ----------

   I have not tried this for a long time, so I have no idea (yet) whether this
   even works anymore on today's linux distributions or not, guessing it can.

 5.3) Network and Routing Considerations
      ----------------------------------

   Multipsk, Winmor, AWGPE, and Direwolf run a TCP/IP server, so programs
   like JNOS 2.0 can connect to them and use them as a software based modem.

   When I first started developing and using programs like Multipsk and Winmor, it
   was a case of my JNOS 2.0 running on some linux host machine, and the software
   based modem running on a physically separate windows PC with a soundcard. Both
   boxes would be connected to my local network.

   In this particular scenario, before you can run the software based modem, you
   have to make sure the Windows machine has a route back to JNOS, since JNOS is
   not directly on the LAN, but reachable via the linux host on which it runs.

   For example :

     JNOS 2.0 (jnos side tun interface) = 192.168.200.201

     JNOS 2.0 (linux side tun interface) = 192.168.200.200

   Note : IP forwarding must be enabled on the linux host machine for this to work. 

     linux machine (LAN Side) = 192.168.1.60

     windows PC (LAN) = 192.168.1.101

   On the Windows PC, bring up an elevated command prompt, then enter :

     route add 192.168.1.201 192.168.1.60

   If you want to make this route permanent (persistent), then use -P option :

     route -P add 192.168.1.201 192.168.1.60

   On the Windows PC, you should now be able to ping your JNOS 2.0 system :

     ping 192.168.1.201

   The so called Windows machine could be a Linux Desktop as well, same idea,
   it's just that the linux route command is a bit different, for example :

     route add 192.168.1.201 gw 192.168.1.60

   There are more creative ways to do this now, perhaps you are running JNOS
   and the software based modem on the same box using virtual box or some kvm
   instance running windows, or perhaps your software based modem is already
   meant to run in linux. Routing can get more complex, as can the craziness
   of some of the firewall rules some linux distributions are using lately.

 5.4) Multipsk by Patrick F6CTE
      -------------------------

   What is cool about Patrick's program is that it has a built-in TCP/IP server,
   allowing outside applications to connect to Multipsk, and use it as a digital
   modem. As of March, 2009, JNOS 2.0 became part of a list of programs able to
   direct connect to Multipsk and use it as a packet (ax25) modem. Patrick was
   kind enough to add the ability to send KISS frames over the tcp/ip server.

   The official site for Multipsk is here :

     http://f6cte.free.fr/index_anglais.htm

   Please visit it to download his software. You must use Multipsk version 4.13
   or higher, earlier versions do not support KISS over tcp/ip server, but that
   comment probably doesn't apply anymore since it's now at version 4.43.1 :)

 5.4.1) Running and Configuring Multipsk
        --------------------------------

   After starting Multipsk, you will find the "Configuration screen".

   Click "TCP/IP server On" button to start automatically the TCP/IP server.

   Click on big button "RX/TX screen" to start the decoder, and authorize
   the TCP/IP connection required by Windows.

   It is strongly recommended to calibrate the sound-card: click on the
   "Adjustments" menu button, then select the "Determination of the RX/TX
   sound-card sampling frequencies" option and push on the "Determination
   of the 48 KHz RX sampling frequency (test on 3 minutes)" button. At
   the end of the test, click on "Return".

   Click on the "PACKET+APRS" orange button.

   To use the TCP/IP possibility, click in the "Options" button which opens
   the window "Packet parameters", then push the "KISS through TCP/IP" button
   located in the "Miscellaneous" box. Click on "OK".

   Push the "KISS" button. That's all for Multipsk.

 5.4.2) Multipsk Additions early 2013
        -----------------------------

   Patrick posted some additional information from the user manual, to the
   Multipsk Yahoo List end of February, 2013 :

    It is reminded that 3 possible parameters can be added on the
    Multipsk command line: TCP_IP_ON to switch the TCP/IP interface on,
    RX_TX_SCREEN to open the RX/TX screen, and MINIMIZE to minimize the
    RX/TX screen (Multipsk appearing as an icone).

  Note about the sound level ("Level" indication in % at the top of the
  screen): an AF level superior or equal to 10 % is OK. About 50 % is ideal
  (but not critical). In case of very low AF level, select "16 bits" in the
  "Determination of the RX/TX sound-card sampling frequencies" option
  ("Adjustments" menu button),

  About the help in Multipsk:

  To bring up the text help (contextual sensitive one), click on the right
  button of the mouse, with the cursor over the mode button "KISS", for
  example).

  Also use the button hints (wait a fraction of second over a button).

 5.4.3) JNOS 2.0 Configuration
        ----------------------

   Simply run the following command at the JNOS console or in autoexec.nos file :

     attach multipsk psk 192.168.1.101 3122

   JNOS 2.0 will try to connect to Multipsk once a minute, watch the JNOS log.

   Once connected, the new 'psk' port is just like any other AX.25 port.

 5.5) WINMOR Sound Card TNC
      ---------------------

   Not for AX.25 (packet), but I was interested in alternatives to the Pactor
   modems, so around the end of April, 2010, I wrote a prototype interface for
   the WINMOR Sound Card TNC software.

      << not sure how I want to discuss this section yet >>

   You may wish to read section 8) HF Digital Device (HFDD) Support.

 5.6) AGW Packet Engine
      -----------------

   The prototype AGWPE interface for JNOS 2.0 came out end of February, 2012,
   and it too has a built-in TCP/IP server, allowing outside applications to
   connect to it, and use it as a digital modem.

   Only single port operation is supported, dual port in the future ? Parameter
   changes are not possible from JNOS. You will have to do it in the the AGWPE
   software itself, which is probably not a bad idea actually.

   JNOS does all the ax25 frame handling, so only 'K' frames are used.

   The official site for SV2AGW Packet Radio is here :

     https://sv2agw.com/ham

 5.6.1) Running and Configuring AGWPE
        -----------------------------

   When you setup a new port, under 'Properties', under 'Tnc Setup',  make sure
   the 'Tnc Sub Type' is set to 'KISS Simple', select 'SinglePort', and uncheck
   the 'ExitKiss On Exit' button.

   Under the 'Tnc Commands' section, select 'Let me Control Parameters', since
   the code does not exist yet for JNOS to adjust the AGW PE parameters itself.

 5.6.2) JNOS 2.0 Configuration
        ----------------------

   Simply run following command at the JNOS console or in autoexec.nos file :

     attach agwpe agw 192.168.1.101 8000

   JNOS will try to connect to AGW PE once a minute - watch the JNOS log.

   Once connected, the new 'agw' port is just like any other AX.25 port.

 5.7) Direwolf
      --------

   Apparently Direwolf uses an AGWPE style interface. I've never tried it, but
   the JNOS 2.0 configuration is identical to how one uses the AGWPE software.

   It's always nice to hear reports that one's software is working. I recently
   received a report from Henk saying he has been using Direwolf with JNOS and
   the AGWPE interface for about a year now, and it works fine. The system is
   up 24/7 and he has never had any problems with the setup. So thank you.

 5.8) SCS WinRPR Robust Packet Software Modem
      ---------------------------------------

   In early November of 2020, I got a tip about a new windows based software
   modem that could do Robust Packet Radio using a sound card. This was very
   exciting, so exciting that I had a new KISS over TCP/IP interface written
   for it in a matter of hours - a stripped down version of my AGWPE driver.

   Thanks Jan (pa3gjx) for bringing it to my attention.

   You can download the SCS WinRPR program from the following website :

     https://www.hamradio.me/graphs/WinRPR_Alpha_Software

 5.8.1) Running and Configuring WinRPR
        ------------------------------

   For now, please check the following website for my notes :

     https://www.langelaar.net/jnos2/robustpacket

   I have actually been using this successfully to gate APRS packets heard
   on 30 meters to the APRS Internet System using NOSaprs, which is part of
   the JNOS 2.0 software. It has been running since around November 14th.

   The ultimate goal is to use my WinRPR setup for HF message forwarding !

 5.8.2) JNOS 2.0 Configuration
        ----------------------

   Simply run the following command at JNOS console or in autoexec.nos file :

     attach rp0 winrpr 10.8.10.6 8001

   Note : replace '10.8.10.6' with whatever IP address you are using.

   JNOS will try to connect to SCS WinRPR once a minute - watch the JNOS log.

   Once connected, the new 'rp0' port is just like any other AX.25 port.

   I'm also trying something different with the logging. If JNOS is not able
   to connect to WinRPR for long periods of time, it will back off the number
   of log entries over time, the idea being not to have 'connect failed' put
   into the log each and every minute, filling up the log - experimental.

 5.9) Fldigi
     -------

   Support for FLDIGI started with JNOS 2.0j.7s - June of 2015

   Ths official site for FLDIGI is -> http://www.w1hkj.com

   JNOS can attach a KISS port to FLDIGI - experimental, for example :

     # connection to fldigi is like AXUDP, using UDP port 10000
     attach axudp hf 256 192.168.1.174 ve4klm 10000 10000

     # then configure the port for FLDIGI KISS mode
     attach fldigi hf

   The comile option (in your config.h) if you don't have it already :

     #define FLDIGI_KISS

   This is NOT a TCP/IP server modem - but routing concepts still apply.

 5.10) EA5HVK VARA HF and VARA FM Software Modems
       ------------------------------------------

   The original VARA software modem support was strictly about PPP over VARA, to
   implement some type of IP Bridge, after a few weeks of experimentation, it is
   fairly clear that PPP over VARA is not great (terrible latency), it certainly
   does work, but it is no where near the most efficient way to utilize VARA.

   The PPP over VARA (IP Bridge) has it's own documentation, see the file :

     https://www.langelaar.net/jnos2/documents/j2varanotes.txt

   The most recent update of the VARA code features the so called Access Mode,
   allowing you to actually forward with Winlink Express running in VARA HF P2P
   mode, please refer to the section immediately below on how to do this.

 5.10.1) Access Mode - Forwarding (B2F) with Winlink Express station
         ------------------------------------------------------------

   All you need to do is attach a VARA interface (just like the PPP stuff), and
   then create an entry in your forward.bbs configuration file, the same as how
   you would setup to any other remote BBS you may be forwarding with, then it
   is just a matter of kicking the mailbox to get things going.

   Here is an example of how you would attach the VARA software modem :

     attach vara vara0 1500 10.8.10.6 8300

   vara0 is the name of the interface (port), 1500 stays as is, 10.8.10.6 is
   the IP address of the windows PC on which VARA software modem is running,
   obviously you would put in your own IP address, and 8300 is the command
   port of the VARA software modem.

   JNOS will automatically set the data channel to command port + 1, so in
   this case the VARA software modem should be configured to use 8300 for
   the command channel and 8301 for the data channel.

   Here is an example of a forward.bbs entry :

     -------
     wq6n
     vara ve4klm wq6n
     wq6n
     -------

   Note the new connect command 'vara', the syntax is simple, first callsign
   is that of your own JNOS system, the second callsign is that of the remote
   system you are calling, easy enough.

   Now you can issue commands like 'mbox kick wq6n' or 'mbox kick Wq6n', you
   can add the Poll option to this forward.bbs entry if you want as well.

   Give section 5.3) Network and Routing Considerations a good read, since
   JNOS and the Windows box running VARA will most likely NOT be directly
   on the same subnet or network. Routing is important for them to talk.

 6) Reference by Remote Call Instead of AX.25 Control Block
    -------------------------------------------------------

   There are three commands in JNOS 1.11f where you have to enter an 8 digit
   hexidecimal identifier known as the AX.25 control block, also shown as axcb
   or &AXB, check the original user manual for the commands below :

     ax25 status [<axcb>]

     ax25 kick <axcb>

     ax25 reset <axcb>

   JNOS 2.0 allows you to specify the remote callsign instead of the &AXB value,
   which I think is a quicker way to kick a session, rather than having to first
   use 'ax25 status' to get the numerical identifier, then trying to remember it,
   and then trying to type it in. This allows you to respond quicker to issues.

   For instance, here is a typical result of using 'ax25 status' :

     jnos> ax25 status
     &AXB     Snd-Q   Rcv-Q   Remote    Local     Iface  State
     00a637e0 0       0       VE2PKT-13 VE4KLM-3  que    Connected
     00ab36b0 0       0       VE3MCH-8  VE4KLM-3  bob    Connected
     00abf260 0       0       AA6HF-4   VE4KLM-3  cal    Connected
     008f1710 0       0                                  Listening

  If I wanted to kick Jack's session, in JNOS 1.11f I would have to :

     ax25 kick 00abf260 

  With JNOS 2.0, it's a simple matter of doing this instead :

     ax25 kick AA6HF-4

  That's not to say you can't use the numerical identifier anymore.

 7) IP Routing to Dyn DNS Style Remote Hosts
    ----------------------------------------

  A route is typically added using the 'route add' command, for example :

     route add 44.64.0.0/16 encap 192.4.8.12

  Check original user manual for 'route [<subcommand>]' for syntax and options.

  JNOS 2.0 allows you to specify a host name instead of the gateway ip address,
  which tells JNOS 2.0 to periodically resolve the host name to make sure that
  we have the 'as current as possible' IP address of the remote gateway.

  So the route command becomes something like the following example :
  
     route add 44.64.0.0/16 encap example.dyndns.org

 8) HF Digital Device (HFDD) Support
    --------------------------------

  << in progress, thanks for your patience >>

 9) SMTP Gateway Options
    --------------------

  New SMTP gateway options, the old way just didn't work for alot of people,
  as it would first try to deliver direct to a host, then to MX if enabled,
  and finally to an smtp gateway (as a last resort) if you had one setup.

  JNOS 2.0 has this enabled by default, but you can check your own config.h for
  the necessary '#define SGW_EXCEPTIONS' entry. If it's missing or is '#undef',
  then just correct it, and do the following :

     rm smtpcli.o smtpserv.o
     make

  * you should not have to do a make clean, it's just a few files.

 9.1) Command Syntax
      --------------

   Two (2) new subcommands have been added to the smtp gateway syntax :

       smtp ga mode [original|force|first|last]

       smtp ga exception add ip mask
       smtp ga exception delete ip mask
       smtp ga exception  (to list)

   The original way to define the gateway has not changed :

       smtp ga [A.B.C.D | none]

   If mode is not configured, then JNOS will function the old way.

   The 'force' mode sends ALL smtp requests direct to the gateway,
   nothing is sent direct to a host, and no MX records are tried.

   The 'first' mode does the same, but allows for exceptions, of
   which are configured using the 'smtp ga exception' subcommand.

   Exceptions basically follow the old way, BUT the gateway will
   not be attempted as a last resort if all else fails.

   Why have a 'force' ? Perhaps you are running 'first' with a
   list of exceptions, and for some reason you need to force all
   traffic to a gateway without having to reconfigure everything.

   The 'last' option does not do anything, and 'original' simply
   switches back to old way - I doubt anyone will use those two.

   Example (this is what I am currently running on my system) :

    smtp ga A.B.C.D

    smtp t4 60          # 1 minute timeout

    smtp ga mode first

    # send everything to gateway except 44 stations, they go direct
    smtp ga exception add 44.0.0.0 0xff000000

    # other exceptions (examples) - you can have as many as you want
    smtp ga exception add E.F.G.0  0xffffff00
    smtp ga exception add X.Y.Z.Z  0xffffffff

   Alot of this functionality actually comes from the 'SMTP Deny Relay
   Exceptions' code (SDRE), which I wrote some time ago. I was able to
   use the same code for this enhancement (with some restructing).

 10) SMTP Deny Relay Exceptions
     --------------------------

  By default, JNOS 1.11f will deny SMTP relay from hosts not in any of our
  subnets, but there may be some we want to allow in. For instance, I would
  use a Thunderbird email client at work to check my JNOS system for new mail
  from time to time, and it would be nice if I could reply to those messages
  using the same email client. The existing '#define SMTP_DENY_RELAY' source
  code did not allow that.

  JNOS 2.0 features a new SMTP Deny Relay Exception (SDRE) list, allowing me
  to do what I described in the previous paragraph.

  Also, the original code would send out an 'Unknown' string whenever JNOS
  had to reply with a 'DENY RELAY' response. With JNOS 2.0, a new 'NoRelay'
  string is used instead, gives a more accurate indication of what's going
  on, instead of confusing the users.

  JNOS 2.0 has this enabled by default, but you can check your own config.h
  for the necessary '#define SDR_EXCEPTIONS' entry. If it is missing, or if
  it is '#undef', then just correct it, and do the following :

     rm smtpcli.o smtpserv.o version.o
     make

  * you should not have to do a make clean, it's just a few files.

 10.1) Command Syntax
       --------------

   From the JNOS 2.0 console (F10) or in your autoexec.nos file :

     smtp relay [add|delete] [ip] [netmask]

     smtp relay [list]

   For instance, the following entry allows me to use my thunderbird client
   well outside any of my JNOS subnets (over an openVPN connection) :

     smtp relay add 10.8.10.6 255.255.255.255

   Of course, you need to make sure you have routing between your JNOS
   and any of the exception networks, and firewalls are not blocking.

 11) Web Interfaces
     --------------

   JNOS 2.0 has multiple Web interfaces for various functions.

 11.1) User BBS
       --------

   You can access the User BBS through your browser, nothing fancy, just
   simplistically functional - a command line text input, and a box text
   area (scrollable) as the main output screen. There are two checkboxes
   at the top as well, one to send CTRL-T, and one to clear the screen.

   When you first connect, you have to enter callsign and password.

 11.1.1) Starting Web Interface
         ----------------------

   From the JNOS 2.0 console (F10) or in your autoexec.nos file :

     start httpvnc [tcp port]

   The tcp port is optional and defaults to 10000 if not specified.

 11.1.2) Accessing Web Interface
         -----------------------

   Point your browser to the httpvnc tcp port of your JNOS system, for example :

     http://192.168.200.201:10000

   You could run a perl based tcp proxy script to forward internet side requests
   to your JNOS hidden deep within your internal networks, for example :

     http://www.langelaar.net:10501

   Or you could use iptables or whatever to do the same.

 11.1.3) Security Considerations
         -----------------------
   
   The httpvnc service is wide open, the JNOS tcp access command should be
   used to tighten up any network access. If you decide to use a tcp proxy
   script to forward internet side, then you need to use firewall rules on
   your actual linux box, since all requests will appear to come from the
   linux box itself, not the remote host asking for it.

   For version 2.0m.5D and later of JNOS, the explanation below no longer
   applies, because I have rewritten portions of the code to use the POST
   mechanism, replacing the GET mechanism used in the original code. The
   explanation has been left here for historic reasons, and my own whim.

   I am working on it, but be warned, the password entered when you first
   access the server, is clearly shown in the URL after you login into the
   web interface, and it's always in sight in the address bar. This was an
   oversight on the original prototype, which I never bothered addressing.
    (well, it is now, but you need to be using JNOS 2.0m.5D or later)

 12) Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)
     ---------------------------------

   In version 2.0m.5E of JNOS, I introduced a prototype implementation of
   what some may refer to as MFA, for incoming telnet sessions, adding an
   important second layer of protection to a protocol used frequently in
   the xNOS world. It's probably not a great idea to open up your telnet
   port to the rest of the world, even if you are able to somehow manage
   access and firewall rules, but if you really need to, adding MFA into
   the process will certainly be a big help in securing your system.

   Disclaimer : I'm not saying that if you use MFA, it gives you reason
                to open up your telnet to the rest of the universe, no.

   MFA is simply a second, or third, or higher level of authentication.

 12.1) How it works for non BBS users
       ------------------------------

   A user telnets into a JNOS system, they get the usual login and
   password prompts, but then they are told to check their mail for
   an authentication code, here is an example screen shot :

     # telnet 192.168.4.201
     Trying 192.168.4.201...
     Connected to 192.168.4.201.
     Escape character is '^]'.

     JNOS (rprjnos)

     login: ve4klm
     Password: 

     Auth (check your mail):

   The user will have received an email something like this :

     Date: Fri, 20 Nov 2020 02:03:10 CST
     From: sysop@rprjnos
     To: maiko@pcsinternet.ca
     Subject: JNOS Authentication Code

     RMCSSUGSIJ

   Simply enter the passcode back at your JNOS telnet session, and you're in !

   If you get it wrong, then you are disconnected. The authentication code is
   randomly generated by JNOS and will be different each and every time there
   is a new incoming telnet session.

 12.2) How it works for BBS users
       --------------------------

   In the case of BBS users, most telnet sessions will be of the forwarding
   kind, which complicates things. Any forwarding scripts will be unable to
   handle these random codes, never mind being able to check emails.

   Of course you could exclude the particular IP address from MFA prompting,
   which is possible, see further below, but that may not be practical ...

   The way around this is that IF a user is marked as a BBS user, then JNOS
   will accept a FIXED VALUE authentication code that has been distributed
   in advance to your (only) incoming telnet forwarding partners. In other
   words, BBS users are not emailed an authentication code. Being this is
   a prototype, there is only one code in use for ALL of your BBS users.
    (maybe down the road we can configure per BBS user, but not now)

   The prompt will look a bit different, this time it's just :

     login: ve4klm
     Password: 

     Auth:

   The fixed value authentication code is set on the MFA enabled JNOS
   system using a new 'mbox MFAfixed <code>' command, for example :

     jnos> mbox MFAfixed A32D#2F

 12.2.1) Forwarding Script required to forward with MFA enabled JNOS
         -----------------------------------------------------------

    Below is a section of my forward.bbs file which lets me telnet forward
    to my MFA enabled JNOS 2.0 test system. This configuration was actually
    refined quite recently (December 1rst, 2020), after finally sitting my
    self down and figuring out how the actual forward.bbs commands work :

     -------
     ve4pkt
     telnet 192.168.200.201
     +login:
     *1
     .ve4pkt
     +Password:
     @1
     .mypassword
     +Auth:
     *1
     .A32D#2F
     mb
     ww
     -------

   If you want a detailed and technical explanation of this same forwarding
   section, then check out the new Section 13, where I heavily document it.

   In the example above, the fixed authentication code expected by the
   system you are forwarding TO is A32D#2F (maximum length 10) ...

   Note to myself : bad example, one should never use their name for a
   password, that's a bad habit that has developed in the xNOS world.

 12.3) Allowing Exemptions to MFA prompting
       ------------------------------------

   You can exclude ip addresses and subnets from getting the MFA prompt,
   using a new 'mbox MFAexclude' command, for example :

     jnos> mbox MFAexclude 127.0.0.1 192.168

   The command is pattern based, put in as many patterns as you want.

   The example above disables MFA prompting when you issue the 'BBS'
   command at the JNOS console, or if I telnet from my hidden network
   or from the linux system hosting my JNOS instance, there should be
   no need for that headache, so instead of hardcoding it, I figured
   this is a better way.

 12.4) Setup of email address for non BBS users
       ----------------------------------------

   Being this is a prototype, I am depending on USERLOG being defined,
   so the email address in use at this time is the one provided by any
   user when use the REGISTER command at the BBS user prompt. We can
   play with that or completely change it for subsequent releases.

 12.5) Setting up the EMAIL side of things
       -----------------------------------

   JNOS has no authenticated SMTP, so what I do on my system is run a
   simple local postfix configuration, with JNOS smtp gateway pointing
   to it, basic SMTP (port 25) as one of the trusted postfix subnets,
   with strict rules on what outgoing email addresses are allowed.

   In fact, I setup email aliases on my postfix, forcing users that
   want to use MFA prompting to use those aliases to get the email to
   the outside world, instead of letting them use whatever email they
   want, it's important to protect the email side of things here.

   I will leave it to the sysop to figure this out on their own.
 
 13) Some NETROM Enhancements
     ------------------------

   No more hardcoding of 2 netrom parameters, and the ability to search
   for a 'pattern' of nodes (both for the BBS user and the JNOS sysop).

 13.1) obsoinit, obsominbc, and acktime can be set by the sysop now
       ------------------------------------------------------------

   As of 2.0m.5B - A couple of parameters previously hardcoded by a few people,
   can now be set at the command line. So please consider using the following
   command instead :

      netrom obsoinit <value>     default is 6, for NEDA use 5
      netrom obsominbc <value>    default is 5, for NEDA use 3

   As for acktime, there has always been a command to set the value :

      netrom acktime <value>      default is 3000

  13.2) BBS user can now pass a filter or pattern to the Nodes command
        --------------------------------------------------------------

  I finally got tired of entering the NODES command at the BBS prompt, only
  to watch several hundred entries stream by and miss the one I want, so now
  you can pass a substring to look for (not the same as a pattern), ie :

     Area: ve4klm (#1) >
     nodes uro
     NJDURO:MB7NJD-5   QSOCCT:N1URO-11   SQLURO:N1URO-13    MFNOS:N1URO-14
     RSBYPI:N1URO-2     X-URO:N1URO-3    BBSURO:N1URO-4    UNIVLE:N1URO-5
      DXURO:N1URO-6
     *** 9 nodes displayed

  The 'nodes *' remains the same, the substring filter is case insensitive.

 13.3) Using a filter or pattern with the netrom route JNOS console command
       --------------------------------------------------------------------

  For the JNOS console, it's a bit more complicated. To accomodate the feature
  into the 'netrom route' console command, the command syntax required fixing.

  Up till now, most people are probably used to entering just 'netrom route'
  to get a node dump, just like if you typed in 'nodes' at the BBS prompt. I
  know it might be convenient, but it breaks syntax convention and makes it
  difficult to add new features, so sorry - you can't do that anymore :)

  Now you have to enter 'netrom route nodes', and if you want to pass the
  substring (like you would at the BBS prompt), then it would look like :

    jnos> netrom route nodes VK 
    DOTXRP:VK2DOT-1   DOTFBB:VK2DOT-6     DOTN:VK2DOT-7    DOTCH:VK2DOT-8
    HGRBBS:VK6HGR-14  HGRNOD:VK6HGR-15  NODHDM:VK7HDM-4
    *** 7 nodes displayed

  This is because 'netrom route' actually has 4 other subcommands, so putting
  in the 'nodes' subcommand brings it all to a nice consistent interface such
  that if you enter just 'netrom route' you see ALL available subcommands.

 13.4) Change of syntax to the netrom route JNOS console command
       ---------------------------------------------------------

  As explained in the previous section, this is just a heads up for people.
  
 14) SID Capture
     -----------

   Recent versions of JNOS 2.0 have the ability to track the SID of incoming
   forwarding sessions, allowing you to track the remote system callsign, as
   well as time last connected, and how they got in (netrom, port, telnet).

   The command to display the entire SID Capture listing is :

     jnos > mbox sid
  
   An example of the listing is shown below :

        [FBB-7.0.10-AB1FHMRX$]
         gb7cip 20:06:02  GB7CIP @ GB7CIP
        [JNOS-2.0.6.URO.C-B1FHIM$]
         ve3cgh 11:37:17  ve3cgh.ampr.org
        [TNOS-3.00-FHIMW$]
         ve2har 18:57:57  VE2HAR-8 @ VE2HAR-9
        [FBB-7.05G-AB1FHM$]
         ve2pkt 17:47:34  VE2PKT @ VE2PKT
        [OPENBCM-1.08-5-G2F4A-AB1D1FHMRW$]
         i0ojj  20:15:10  host-79-52-228-200.retail.telecomitalia.it
        [JNOS-2.0M-B1FHIM$]
         ve3tok 20:24:55  port.ve3mch.ampr.org
        [JNOS-2.0M.5C-B1FHIM$]

         ve3cgr 17:58:20  jnos.ve3cgr.ampr.org
         aa6hf  20:24:03  AA6HF-8 on port cal
         i0ojj  20:13:19  i0ojj.ampr.org
        [BPQ-6.0.20.10-B1FIHJM$]
         va3tok 20:14:05  linux.ve3mch.ampr.org
        [JNOS-2.0M.5B-B1FHIM$]
         n2nov  18:09:25  1d N2NOV-4 on port newyork
        [FBB-7.07-AB1FHM$]
         ve3tok 20:11:25  linux.ve3mch.ampr.org
        [WL2K-5.0-B2FWIHJM$]
         wl2k   03:39:54  1d winlink-lb-628697408.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com

   You will notice the collected information is grouped by SID, giving you a
   decent idea of the software other systems are using to forward with you.

   This is also useful in that it shows if any remote systems have upgraded
   their software. For example you may see entries like theses below :

        [JNOS-2.0M.5D-B1FHIM$]
         ve3tok 01:22:41  port.ve3mch.ampr.org
         n2nov  01:40:15  N2NOV-4 on port newyork
         ve3cgr 01:23:44  jnos.ve3cgr.ampr.org
         i0ojj  19:33:51  i0ojj.ampr.org
        [JNOS-2.0M-B1FHIM$]
         ve3tok 00:55:50  4d port.ve3mch.ampr.org
        [JNOS-2.0M.5C-B1FHIM$]
         aa6hf  01:34:15  AA6HF-8 on port cal
         i0ojj  14:28:08  8d i0ojj.ampr.org
         n2nov  00:20:00  11d N2NOV-4 on port newyork
         ve3cgr 08:25:41  12d jnos.ve3cgr.ampr.org

   Note the very last entry for Ron (ve3cgr) with '12d' in it. This is
   telling you that his system was last heard using JNOS 2.0m.5C 12 days
   ago at 8:25:41 local time. If you look further up, you will see he's
   now using JNOS 2.0m.5D and he last connected today at 1;23:44 local
   time. In other words he probably upgraded his system 12 days ago.

   I wish I could show examples of the other software upgrading during
   my JNOS runtimes, but being this is my development system, it never
   runs for long enough for that to usually show up (but it will).

 14.1) SID Capture to file
       -------------------

   At this time, if you restart JNOS, the SID Capture listing is lost. I have
   yet to create a save or load feature, so an alternate way for you to save
   the data is to simply redirect the jnos console command file like this :

     jnos> mbox sid > /tmp/mbox.sid.27Nov2020.txt

   Then from the linux prompt, you can retrieve the content as follows :

     root@slackware:/jnos/src/dev_2.0m.4# more /tmp/mbox.sid.27Nov2020.txt

         [FBB-7.0.10-AB1FHMRX$]
          gb7cip 20:06:02  GB7CIP @ GB7CIP
         [JNOS-2.0.6.URO.C-B1FHIM$]
          ve3cgh 11:37:17  ve3cgh.ampr.org
         [TNOS-3.00-FHIMW$]
           ...

   You can use the jnos console 'at' command to schedule it if you like.

 15) Enhanced Trace Command
     ----------------------

   The problem with tracing to a file was that the operating system would only
   flush to disk every so often (which makes sense of course), but if you had to
   use the file for realtime monitoring, it wasn't very practical at times.

   In version 2.0i, November 23, 2010 (in the release history) I added syncing
   or flushing of the trace log files. By syncing the log file every few seconds
   or milliseconds (user selectable), it suddenly became very practical to use.

   The 'trace' command now features an extra parameter (in milliseconds).

   For example, to trace port ax0 to file, and flush to disk every 1 second :

     jnos> trace ax0 0x211 ax0.log 1000

   If you specify a sync value less then one second, you are warned :

     jnos> trace encap 0x211 encap06Dec2020.log 500
     warning - your sync is under one second !!!
     encap: input output (Hex/ASCII dump) trace file: encap06Dec2020.log sync: 500 ms

   Note : small sync values can use up CPU and affect your JNOS performance !

   For realtime monitoring, you can then run a tail command on the linux side :

     root@slackware:/jnos/rte# tail -f encap06Dec2020.log 
     IP: len 32 44.135.92.10->44.135.124.1 ihl 20 ttl 62 prot ICMP
     ICMP: type Echo Request id 132 seq 0
     0000  45 00 00 20 71 41 00 00 3e 01 da 82 2c 87 5c 0a  E.. qA..>.Z.,.\.
     0010  2c 87 7c 01 08 00 b4 f6 00 84 00 00 66 72 dc 12  ,.|...4v....fr\.

     Sun Dec  6 14:14:10 2020 - encap sent:
     IP: len 32 44.135.124.1->44.135.92.10 ihl 20 ttl 254 prot ICMP
     ICMP: type Echo Reply id 132 seq 0
     0000  45 00 00 20 f5 fa 00 00 fe 01 95 c8 2c 87 7c 01  E.. uz..~..H,.|.

 16) The RDATE Comand (gone)
     -----------------------

 Chances are you will have to #undef RDATECLI at some point, the reason being
 the stime() function no longer exists in the more recent gcc/glibc versions.

 If you don't do it, you MAY get an unresolved reference to stime() during the
 linkage portion of the compile. It isn't a simple change, and since we already
 have 'ntpd' on the linux side, there's no point supporting 'rdate' anymore.

 17) JNOS Log Triggers
     -----------------

 As of 2.0m.3, JNOS has the ability to run commands based on what it sees in the
 main log file - in real time. Documentation is very rough, and this feature is
 still very much the prototype version, it still needs work (revamping perhaps).

 The best way for me to explain it at this time is by examples :

 a) notify me 'instantly' if Ron's system times out during a session

     log trigger add "VE3CGR&timed out&" "mailmsg ve4klm \"ve3cgr timeout\""

 This looks for 2 phrases "VE3CGR" AND "timed out" and invokes the JNOS
 mailmsg console command to email me saying we've timed out.

 Note the use of & for BOTH phrase, it's case sensitive (currently), and also
 note you can include spaces in a phrase. The command only happens if BOTH of
 the  phrases match !

 b) run a shell script if any particular words show up in the log

     log trigger add "error|warning|WARNING|" "sh ./notifyme.sh"

 This looks for 3 phrases "error" OR "warning" OR "WARNING" and runs the shell
 script 'notifyme.sh'. The script will run if ANY single phrases is matched.

 At present you can NOT mix use of the '&' and '|' operators.

 If you have only one phrase, you still need to terminate with an operator, either
 one will do. The whole matching algorithm needs work, it's not pretty, sorry !

 Documentation could be better, but the examples should help for now ?

 18) Enhanced AX25 Heard List
     ------------------------

 JNOS 2.0 tracks calls heard via a digipeater, complimenting the existing lists
 of calls heard direct, and destination calls heard. As well, you can now save
 the entire AX25 heard (all 3 lists) to file, and you can load them from file.

 So you can now actually monitor for stations not directly heard. This feature
 came about due to my crazy obsession with Robust Packet lately and seeing all
 the APRS frames coming in on 30 meters, many via K4KPN-10, so it was nice to
 to know who else was actually on frequency, without hearing them directly.

 The syntax of 'ax25 heard' has changed from the original JNOS, ie :

   jnos> ax25 heard

   Display stations heard on ax25 interfaces

    Usage : ax heard *[ dest | digid ] all | <iface>

            ax heard save | load *[ filename ]

      * denotes an optional single argument

    Some examples below :

      ax25 h all            traditional syntax, but requires 'all' for ALL ports
      ax25 h digid rp0      NEW show stations heard via a digipeater on port rp0
      ax25 h ax0            traditional syntax, show directly heard port ax0
      ax25 h dest all       show destination calls heard on ALL ports

    Note : 'ax25 dest' and 'ax25 hearddest' are no more - use 'ax25 heard' now.
     (the default save or load file is 'AxHeardFile' in JNOS root directory)

   You 'could' add these commands to the very end of your autoexec.nos :

       # 21May2021, Load the last saved heard lists
       ax25 heard load /tmp/newsaveit.txt

       # 21May2021, save heard lists every 15 minutes from this moment on
       at now+0015 "ax25 heard save /tmp/newsaveit.txt+"

   That way you can keep a list going for as long as you want, it will always
   be maintained everytime you restart your JNOS system, and the time stamps
   should be fairly well preserved in the process ...

 19) The APRS side of JNOS
     ---------------------

 Did you know JNOS 2.0 has APRS capabilities - the NOSaprs 'module'. My
 original documentation can be found at the website (URL) below :

    https://www.langelaar.net/projects/nosaprs

 19.1) The APRS 'destination' call or 'tocall'
       ---------------------------------------

 In mid June, Bob Bruninga WB4APR was kind enough to add an entry for NOSaprs
 to his official 'tocall' list maintained at the website (URL) below :

    http://aprs.org/aprs11/tocalls.txt

 NOSaprs is now 'assigned' APN2XX, with APZ200 noted as being used by older
 versions of JNOS. It's been quite some time since NOSaprs was introduced,
 so it's not really experimental anymore.

 Thank you Janusz HF1L (ex.SP1LOP) for suggesting this change.

 If you use NOSaprs to TX, then you can set the APRS path as follows :

    # 30Dec2020, So K4KPN-10 and others will catch it and pass it on further
    ax25 route add apn20h rp0 wide1-1

 In the above example, rp0 is my robust packet port on 30 meters.

 20) Enhanced TCP Access Controls
     ----------------------------

 The tcp access function now allows you to insert an entry anywhere into the
 list. Before this, you could only add entries to the end of the list, so if
 you wanted to insert a new record you would have to first delete the latest
 record (or more), then add the new one, then re-add the deleted one(s).

 You might as well just have reconfigured your rules in autoexec.nos, and
 then restarted your JNOS instead. But no more - check the next section !

 20.1) Insertion or removal of entries at specific positions in the list
       -----------------------------------------------------------------

 The new syntax for 'tcp access' is as follows :

 tcp access <permit|deny|delete> [L#] <dest addr>[/<bits>] [lowport [highport]]

 Note the new OPTIONAL [L#] argument. So if you wanted to insert at the very
 top of the list, you would use L0. Use L1 if you wanted to go down 1 entry
 from the top, and so on. The # denotes depth from top, and note there is no
 space between the L and #. Other than that, the command remains the same.

 The L# option does NOT apply to the 'delete' function.

 20.2) Blackinglisting of bad telnet logins
       ------------------------------------

 Many of us get bogus telnet login attempts with user names like root, admin,
 or sh, whatever, basically non-ham calls. So that got me thinking ! Why not
 give the sysop the option of blacklisting the IP addresses responsible for
 these login attempts - kind of like the sshblack script from years back,
 but do it JNOS style.

 Use the following command to enable this feature :

   mbox blacklist N

 where N is a numerical value. 0 means no blacklisting, N is a time value in
 seconds after which the blacklist expires for any particular IP address. The
 expiry value is only relevant if you choose to run the new tcp access expiry
 process, explained further below. If you don't run expiry, then of course the
 entries will stay until JNOS is restarted, regardless of the value of N.

 The blacklist feature uses the newly added tcp access enhancement to do its
 work - the initial reason for doing the enhancement in the first place ...

 IF you blacklist, you have to (at minimum) have the following :

   tcp access permit all

 The blacklist code inserts DENY rules PRIOR to existing entries, so even if
 you are not using 'tcp access', at minimum you need the above default rule.

 20.2.1) Expiry of Blacklisted items
         ---------------------------

 You can have JNOS expire blacklist entries at regular intervals. A new sub
 command has been added to 'tcp access' :

   tcp access expiry N

 where N is in minutes. If you do not run this, your blacklist will continue
 to grow indefinitely. Nobody says you have to expire them, but your choice.

 20.2.2) An example configuration for your autoexec.nos
         ----------------------------------------------

   # blacklist must have minimum a 'permit all' entry
    tcp access permit all

   # blacklist bad logins for 15 minutes (900 seconds)
   mbox blacklist 900

   # run expiry process every 20 minutes
   tcp access expiry 20

 21) New DATE command
     ----------------

 Added a new 'date' command for the JNOS console, for example :

   jnos> date
   Mon Jul 25 17:04:22 2022

 I had been using 'sh date' in my JNOS scripts, but I found this to result in
 loads of linux zombie processes - so I figured why not just get it directly.

 22) Customizable help and usage dialogues, minimizing hardcoded help info
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

 Slowly and surely I am trying to get rid of hardcoded help and/or usage
 dialogues in the JNOS source code ; replacing them instead with document
 files loaded from disk, allowing users to customize the content, perhaps
 even create them in a different language to better suite their users ?

 A new directory has been added to the JNOS runtime area, for example :

   /jnos/rte/usage

 The latest layout as of this writing is as follows :

   bash-5.1# ls -ls /jnos/rte/usage
   4 -rw-r--r-- 1 jnos jnos   91 Nov 26  2020 MFAexclude.txt
   4 drwxr-xr-x 2 jnos jnos 4096 Jun 28  2020 aprs
   4 drwxr-xr-x 2 jnos jnos 4096 Apr 12  2021 ax25
   4 -rw-r--r-- 1 jnos jnos 1063 Jun 28  2020 log.txt
   4 -rw-r--r-- 1 jnos jnos  266 Apr 23 13:32 snmp.txt
   4 -rw-r--r-- 1 jnos jnos  311 Jun 28  2020 winlinkcalls.txt

 Several JNOS commands already make use of these new files, using the new
 function, getusage(), which I wrote near the end of May in 2020. It also
 boasts a prefix feature, which allows you to group subcommands of higher
 level commands like aprs and ax25 into their own subdirectory, as shown
 in the listing above. You can edit these to your liking, and you don't
 have to restart JNOS either after changing their contents.

 I have considered a future language code, so one can have multiple help
 and usage files for the same command, but each in a different language,
 based on the language possible configured for a sysop or BBS user, but
 that's just an idea at this time.

 23) The JNOS log - option to select daily or single running
     -------------------------------------------------------

 Back in November of 214, I added Bob's (VE3TOK) mods so that you can now
 specify a single running nos.log, instead of the daily versions, this is
 not a compile time option, decided to make it runtime instead,

 23.1) Syntax for LOG command
       ----------------------

     Usage: log file [ nos.log | daily ] THEN log [ on | off]
            disk logging is ON, logfile type is DDMMMYY (daily)
